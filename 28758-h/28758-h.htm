<h3><i>The Introduction.</i></h3>

  <p>Whereas there is nothing more necessary for promoting the improvement
  of Philosophical Matters, than the communicating to such, as apply their
  Studies and Endeavours that way, such things as are discovered or put in
  practise by others, it is therefore thought fit to employ the
  <i>Press</i>, as the most proper way to gratifie those, whose engagement
  in such Studies, and delight in the advancement of Learning and
  profitable Discoveries, doth entitle them to the knowledge of what this
  Kingdom, or other parts of the World, do, from time to time, afford, as
  well <!-- Page 2 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page2"></a>{2}</span>of the progress of the Studies, Labours, and
  attempts of the Curious and learned in things of this kind, as of their
  compleat Discoveries and performances: To the end, that such Productions
  being clearly and truly communicated, desires after solid and usefull
  knowledge may be further entertained, ingenious Endeavours and
  Undertakings cherished, and those, addicted to and conversant in such
  matters, may be invited and encouraged to search, try, and find out new
  things, impart their knowledge to one another, and contribute what they
  can to the Grand design of improving Natural knowledge, and perfecting
  all <i>Philosophical Arts</i>, and <i>Sciences</i>. All for the Glory of
  God, the Honour and Advantage of these Kingdoms, and the Universal Good
  of Mankind.</p>

<h3><i>An Accompt of the improvement of</i> Optick Glasses.</h3>

  <p>There came lately from <i>Paris</i> a Relation, concerning the
  Improvement of <i>Optick Glasses</i>, not long since attempted at
  <i>Rome</i> by Signor <i>Giuseppe Campani</i>, and by him discoursed of,
  in a Book, Entituled, <i>Ragguaglio di nuoue Osservationi</i>, lately
  printed in the said City, but not yet transmitted into these parts;
  wherein these following particulars, according to the Intelligence, which
  was sent hither, are contained.</p>

  <p>The <i>First</i> regardeth the excellency of the long
  <i>Telescopes</i>, made by the said <i>Campani</i>, who pretends to have
  found a way to work great <i>Optick Glasses</i> with a Turne-tool,
  without any Mould: And whereas hitherto it hath been found by Experience,
  that <i>small</i> Glasses are in proportion better to see with, upon the
  Earth, than the <i>great</i> ones; that Author affirms, that his are
  equally good for the Earth, and for making Observations in the Heavens.
  Besides, he useth three Eye-Glasses for his great <i>Telescopes</i>,
  without finding any <i>Iris</i>, or such Rain-bow colours, as do usually
  appear in ordinary Glasses, and prove an impediment to Observations.</p>

  <p>The <i>Second</i>, concerns the <i>Circle of Saturn</i>, in which he
  hath observed nothing, but what confirms Monsieur <i>Christian Huygens de
  Zulichem</i> his Systeme of that Planet, published by that worthy
  Gentleman in the year, 1659. <!-- Page 3 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page3"></a>{3}</span></p>

  <p>The <i>Third</i>, respects <i>Jupiter</i>, wherein <i>Campani</i>
  affirms he hath observed by the goodness of his Glasses, certain
  <i>protuberancies</i> and <i>inequalities</i>, much greater than those
  that have been seen therein hitherto. He addeth, that he is now
  observing, whether those sallies in the said <i>Planet</i> do not change
  their scituation, which if they should be found to do, he judgeth, that
  <i>Jupiter</i> might then be said to turn upon his <i>Axe</i>; which, in
  his opinion, would serve much to confirm the opinion of
  <i>Copernicus</i>. Besides this, he affirms, he hath remarked in the
  <i>Belts</i> of <i>Jupiter</i>, the shaddows of his <i>satellites</i>,
  and followed them, and at length seen them emerge out of his Disk.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<h3><i>A Spot in one of the Belts of Jupiter.</i></h3>

  <p>The Ingenious Mr. <i>Hook</i> did, some moneths since, intimate to a
  friend of his, that he had, with an excellent twelve foot Telescope,
  observed, some days before, he than spoke of it, (<i>videl.</i> on the
  ninth of <i>May</i>, 1664, about 9 of the clock at night) a small Spot in
  the biggest of the 3 obscurer <i>Belts</i> of <i>Jupiter</i>, and that,
  observing it from time to time, he found, that within 2 hours after, the
  said Spot had moved from East to West, about half the length of the
  Diameter of <i>Jupiter</i>.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<h3><i>The Motion of the late Comet prædicted.</i></h3>

  <p>There was lately sent to one of the <i>Secretaries</i> of the <i>Royal
  Society</i> a Packet, containing some Copies of a Printed Paper,
  Entituled, The <i>Ephemerides</i> of the <i>Comet</i>, made by the same
  Person, that sent it, called <i>Monsieur Auzout</i>, a <i>French</i>
  Gentleman of no ordinary Merit and Learning, who desired, that a couple
  of them might be recommended to the said <i>Society</i>, and one to their
  <i>President</i>, and another to his Highness Prince <i>Rupert</i>, and
  the rest to some other Persons, nominated by him in a Letter that
  accompanied this present, and known abroad for their singular abilities
  and knowledge in Philosophical Matters. The end of the Communication of
  this Paper was, That, the motion of the <i>Comet</i>, that hath lately
  appeared, having been prædicted by the said <i>Monsieur <!-- Page 4
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page4"></a>{4}</span>Auzout</i>, after
  he had seen it (as himself affirms) but 4 or 5 times: the <i>Virtuosi</i>
  of <i>England</i>, among others, might compare also their Observations
  with his <i>Ephemerides</i>, either to confirm the <i>Hypothesis</i>,
  upon which the <i>Author</i> had before hand calculated the way of this
  Star, or to undeceive him, if he be in a mistake. The said Author
  Dedicateth these his conceptions to the most Christian King, telling him,
  that he presents Him with a design, which never yet was undertaken by any
  <i>Astronomer</i>, all the World having been hitherto perswaded, that the
  motions of <i>Comets</i> were so irregular, that they could not be
  reduced to any Laws, and men having contented themselves, to observe
  exactly the places, through which they did pass; but no man, that he
  knows, having been so bold as to venture to foretel the places, through
  which they should pass, and where they should cease to appear: Whereas he
  exhibites here the <i>Ephemerides</i>, determining day by day, in what
  place of the Heavens this <i>Comet</i> shall be, at what hour it shall be
  in its <i>Meridian</i>, and at what hour it shall set; untill its too
  great remoteness, or the approach of the Sun, hide it from our eyes.
  Descending to particulars, he saith, that this Star, being disengaged
  from the beams of the Sun might have been observed, if his conjectures be
  good, ever since it hath been of 17 or 18 degrees <i>Southern
  Latitude</i>, and that about the middle of <i>November</i> last, and
  sooner, unless it have been too small: That however it hath been seen in
  <i>Holland</i> ever since the <i>2d.</i> of <i>December</i> last, at
  which time, according to his reckoning, the Diurnal motion of the
  <i>Comet</i> should already amount to 17 or 18 minutes. He finds, that
  this Star moveth <i>just enough</i> in the Plan of a <i>Great Circle</i>,
  which inclineth to the <i>Equinoctial</i> about 30 degrees, and to the
  <i>Ecliptick</i> about 49<i>d.</i> or 49½ cutting the <i>Equator</i> at
  about 45<i>d</i>½, and the <i>Ecliptick</i> at the 28<i>d</i> of
  <i>Aries</i>, or a little more. He saith <i>just enough</i>, because he
  thinks, there may perhaps be some <i>parallaxe</i>, which he wisheth
  could be determined.</p>

  <p>Hence, (<i>so he goes on</i>) every one who pleaseth, may see, in
  tracing the <i>Comet</i> upon the <i>Globe</i>, through, or by which
  Stars it hath passed and shall pass; adding, that there will be neither
  cause to wonder, that having descended to about 6. deg. beneath the
  <i>Tropick</i> of <i>Capricorn</i>, he hath remounted afterwards, and
  shall go <!-- Page 5 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page5"></a>{5}</span>on ascending so, as to pass the
  <i>Æquinoctial</i>, and perhaps proceed to 15. degrees <i>Northern
  Declination</i>, if it do not disappear before that time, by reason of
  its remoteness: Nor to believe, that there have been two <i>Comets</i>,
  upon its being seen again the 31. of <i>December</i>; since, according to
  him, it ought to have been so, if it continue to move in a <i>Great
  Circle</i>.</p>

  <p>Having hereupon shewed, how the motion is to be traced upon the
  <i>Globe</i>, he finds, that, according to his Calculation, this
  <i>Comet</i> was to pass the <i>Tropick</i> of <i>Capricorn</i> about the
  16 of <i>December</i>, and being entred into the Sign of <i>Virgo</i> on
  the 20. of the same month, and having been in <i>Quadrat</i> with the
  <i>Sun</i>, it should still descend, until the 26 of <i>December</i> in
  the morning, and then enter into <i>Leo</i>; that having entred, the 28.
  of the same month, into <i>Cancer</i>, and been, a little after that
  time, in its greatest Inclination to the <i>Ecliptick</i>, vid in the 28.
  degree of <i>Leo</i>, it was to repass the <i>Southern Tropick</i>, over
  against the <i>little Dogg</i>, on the 29. of <i>December</i> about 9 or
  10 of the clock in the morning, after it had been opposite to the
  <i>Sun</i> 2. or 3. hours before; and that on the 29. of <i>December</i>
  in the evening it should be in <i>Gemini</i>; and at the very beginning
  of the New year, enter into <i>Taurus</i>.</p>

  <p>After this, our Author finds, that this <i>Comet</i>, according to his
  account, should pass the <i>Æquator</i>, on the 4. of <i>January</i>
  before noon, and that about 5. or 6. of the clock in the evening of that
  day it was to come into the jaw of the <i>Whale</i>, and the 9. of the
  same, at 6. of the clock it should come close to the small Star of the
  <i>Whale</i>, which is in its way, a little below. At length he finds
  that it was to enter into <i>Aries</i> on the 12. of <i>January</i>, and
  to cut the <i>Ecliptick</i> on the 16. of the same month about noon, at
  which time it was to be again in <i>Quadrat</i> with the <i>Sun</i>,
  whence drawing a little to above the <i>Northern Line</i> of
  <i>Pisces</i>, it should in his opinion cease to appear a little beyond
  that place, without going as far as to the middle of <i>Aries</i>, if so
  be that its remoteness make it not disappear sooner.</p>

  <p>He continueth, and saith, that this <i>Comet</i> shall not arrive to
  the place over against the <i>Line</i> of <i>Pisces</i> till the 10 of
  <i>February</i>, &amp; that then its <i>Diurnal</i> motion shall not
  exceed 8 minutes, and not 5 minutes about the 20 of the same month: and
  that in the <!-- Page 6 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page6"></a>{6}</span>beginning of <i>March</i>, if we see it so
  long, the said motion shall not exceed 4 minutes, and so shall be still
  diminishing; except the <i>Comet</i> become <i>Retrograde</i>, which, as
  very important, he would have well observed; as also, whether its motion
  will be about the end more or less swift, than he hath calculated it.</p>

  <p>He subjoyneth, that the greatest way, which this Star could make in
  24. hours, hath been 13. <i>d.</i> 25&prime;; and in one houre, about
  34&prime;; and thinking it probable, that about the time, when it made so
  much way, it should be nearest to the <i>Earth</i>, he concludeth that
  its motion in 24. hours must be, in its least distance from the
  <i>Earth</i>, as about 3. to 14, or 1. to 4&#x2154;, and that its motion
  in one hour was to be to the same least distance, as about 1. to
  102<sup>1</sup>/<sub>7</sub>.</p>

  <p>But that, which he judgeth most <span class="correction"
  title="Original reads `rewarkable'.">remarkable</span>, is, that he found
  by his Calculation, that the said least distance should be on the 29. of
  <i>December</i>, when the <i>Comet</i> was opposite to the Sun; which he
  does not know whether it may not serve to decide the grand Question
  concerning the <i>Motion of the Earth</i>.</p>

  <p>He taketh further notice, that the <i>Tayl</i> of the <i>Comet</i> was
  to turn <i>Westward</i>, with a point to the <i>North</i>, until the 29.
  of <i>December</i>, at which time it was to be opposite to the
  <i>Sun</i>, and that then the said <i>Tayl</i> was to look directly
  <i>North</i>; but that, after that time, the <i>Tayl</i> was to turn
  <i>Eastward</i>, and continue to do so, until it disappear; and that it
  shall draw a little towards the <i>North</i>, until the 8. or 10. of
  <i>February</i>, at which time the <i>Tayl</i> is to be parallel to the
  <i>Æquator</i>, as if the <i>Comet</i> be <i>yet</i> seen for some time
  after, the <i>Tayl</i> shall go a little lower towards the <i>South</i>,
  but grow smaller.</p>

  <p>He finds by his <i>Hypothesis</i>, that on the 2. of <i>December</i>,
  which is the first observation, that he hath heard of, this Star was to
  be about 7. times more remote from the <i>Earth</i>, than when it was in
  its <i>Perigeum</i>; and that it will be again in an equall remoteness
  from the <i>Earth</i>, on the 27. of <i>January</i>, so that he is of
  opinion, that in case this <i>Comet</i> have not been seen before the 2.
  of <i>December</i>, it will not be seen any more after the 27. of
  <i>January</i>.</p>

  <p>He wishes above all things, that it might be very exactly observed, at
  what Angle the way of the <i>Comet</i> cuts the <i>Æquator</i>, and, most
  of all, the <i>Ecliptick</i>, that so it may be seen, whether <!-- Page 7
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page7"></a>{7}</span>there hath not
  been some <i>Parallaxe</i> in the <i>Circle</i> of his Motion; as also,
  that some observations could be had of its greatest descent beneath the
  <i>Tropick of Capricorn</i> in the more <i>Southern</i> parts, where he
  saith it would have been without <i>Refractions</i>; Moreover of the
  Time, when it hath been in <i>Quadrat</i> with the <i>Sun</i> about the
  20 of <i>December</i>; and that also very exact Observation might be made
  of the time of its being again in <i>Quadrat</i> with the <i>Sun</i>,
  which, according to him, was to be <i>January</i> 16.</p>

  <p>He wishes also, that some in <i>Madagascar</i> may have observed this
  Star; Seeing that it began to appear over the middle of that
  <i>Island</i>, and passed twice over their heads; he judgeth, that they
  have seen it before us. And he wisheth lastly, that there were some
  intelligent person in <i>Guiana</i> to observe it there, seeing that
  within a few daies, according to his reckoning, it will pass over their
  Heads, and will not remove from thence but 8 or 10 degrees Northward,
  where he saith, it will disappear; thinking it improbable, that it can
  still appear, after the <i>Sun</i> shall have passed it.</p>

  <p>This Account beareth date of the 2. <i>January</i>, new stile, 1665.
  and the Author thereof addeth this Note, That, seeing it could not be
  printed nor distributed so soon as he desired, he hath had the
  opportunity to verifie it by some Observations, from which he affirms he
  hath found no sensible difference; or, if there be, that it proceeds only
  from thence, that the Stars have advanced, since his <i>Globe</i> was
  made. He concludeth, that if this continue, and the first Observations do
  likewise agree, or that the differences do arrive within the Times
  ghessed by him, that he hopes, he shall determine both the
  <i>Distance</i> and the <i>Magnitude</i> of this <i>Comet</i>; and that
  perhaps one may be enabled to decide the Question of the <i>Motion of the
  Earth</i>. In the interim, he assureth, that he hath not changed the
  least number in his Calculations, and that <i>Monsieur Huygens</i>, and
  several French Gentlemen, to whom he saith, he hath given them long
  since, can bear him witness that he hath done so; as also many other
  friends of his, who saw upon his <i>Globe</i>, several daies before, the
  way of the <i>Comet</i> from day to day.</p>

  <p>Thus for the <i>Parisian</i> Account of the Comet, which is here
  inserted at large, that the intelligent and curious in <i>England</i> may
  <!-- Page 8 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page8"></a>{8}</span>compare their Observations therewith, either
  to verifie these <i>Prædictions</i>, or to shew wherein they differ;
  which is (as was also hinted above) the design of this <i>Philosophical
  Prophet</i> in dispersing his Conceptions, who declareth himself ready,
  in case he be mistaken in his reckoning, to learn another
  <i>Hypothesis</i>, to explicate these admirable appearances by.</p>

  in great part already Printed; He did lately very obligingly present
  several Copies of so much as was Printed, to the <i>Royal Society</i>,
  with a desire that some of the Members thereof might be engaged to peruse
  the Book, and select out of it for trial, the hints of such Experiments,

  the Press. It will be accompanied with some Discourses of the same
  <i>Author</i>, concerning <i>New Thermometrical Experiments and
  Thoughts</i>, as also, with an Exercitation about the <i>Doctrine of the
  Antiperistasis</i>: In the former whereof is <i>first</i> proposed this
  <i>Paradox</i>, That not only our Senses, but common Weather-glasses, may
  mis-inform us about Cold. <i>Next</i>, there are contained in this part,
  New Observations about the deficiencies of Weather-glasses, together with
  some considerations touching the New or <i>Hermetrical</i> Thermometers.
  <i>Lastly</i>, they deliver another <i>Paradox</i>, touching the cause of
  the Condensation of the Air, and Ascent of water by cold in common
  Weather-glasses. The latter piece of this part contains an Examen of
  <i>Antiperistasis</i>, as it is wont to be <i>taught</i> and

<h3><i>An Account of a very odd Monstrous Calf.</i></h3>

  <p>By the same Noble person was lately communicated to the <i>Royal
  Society</i> an account of a very Odd Monstrous Birth, produced at
  <i>Limmington</i> in <i>Hampshire</i>, where a Butcher, having caused a
  Cow (which cast her Calf the year before) to be covered, that she might
  the sooner be fatted, killed her when fat, and opening the Womb, which he
  found heavy to admiration, saw in it a Calf, which had begun to have
  hair, whose hinder Leggs had no Joynts, and whose Tongue was,
  <i>Cerberus</i>-like, triple, to each side of his Mouth one, and one in
  the midst: Between the Fore-leggs and the Hinder-leggs was a great Stone,
  on which the Calf rid: the <i>Sternum</i>, or that part of the Breast,
  where the Ribs lye, was also perfect Stone; and the Stone, on which it
  rid, weighed twenty pounds and a half; the outside of the Stone was of
  Grenish colour, but some small parts being broken off, it appeared a
  perfect Free-stone. The Stone, according to the Letter of Mr. <i>David
  Thomas</i>, who sent this Account to Mr. <i>Boyle</i>, is with Doctor
  <i>Haughteyn</i> of <i>Salisbury</i>, to whom he also referreth for
  further Information.</p>

<h3><i>Of a peculiar Lead-Ore of </i>Germany<i>, and the Use
thereof.</i></h3>

  <p>There was, not long since, sent hither out of <i>Germany</i> from an
  inquisitive Physician, a List of several <i>Minerals</i> and
  <i>Earths</i> of that Country, and of <i>Hungary</i>, together with a
  <i>Specimen</i> of each of them: among which there was a kind of
  <i>Lead-Ore</i> which is more considerable than all the rest, because of
  its singular use for <i>Essays</i> upon the <i>Coppell</i>, seeing that
  there is not any other <i>Mettal</i> mixed with it. 'Tis found in the
  <i>Upper Palatinate</i>, at a place called <i>Freyung</i>, and there are
  two sorts of it, whereof one is a kind of Crystalline Stone, and almost
  all good Lead; the other not so rich, and more farinaceous. By the
  information, coming along with it, they are fetcht, not from under the
  ground, but, the Mines of that place having lain long neglected, by
  reason of the Wars of <i>Germany</i> and the increase of Waters, the
  people, living <!-- Page 11 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  Forefathers had thrown away, and had lain long in the open Air. The use
  above mentioned being considerable, the person, who sent it, hath been
  intreated, to inform what quantities may be had of it, if there should be
  occasion to send for some.</p>

<h3><i>Of an Hungarian Bolus, of the same Effect with the Bolus

  <p>The same person gave notice also, that, besides the <i>Bolus
  Armenus</i>, and the <i>Terra Silesiaca</i>, there is an Earth to be
  found in <i>Hungary</i> about the River <i>Tockay</i>, thence called
  <i>Bolus Tockaviensis</i>, having as good effects in <i>Physick</i>, as
  either of the former two, and commended by experience in those parts, as
  much as it is by <i>Sennertus</i> out of <i>Crato</i>, for its

<h3><i>Of the New </i>American<i> Whale-fishing about the Bermudas.</i></h3>

  <p>Here follows a Relation, somewhat more divertising, than the precedent
  Accounts, which is about the new <i>Whale fishing</i> in the
  <i>West-Indies</i> about the <i>Bermudas</i>, as it was delivered by an
  understanding and hardy Sea-man, who affirmed he had been at the killing
  work himself. His account, as far as remembred, was this; that though
  hitherto all Attempts of mastering the Whales of those Seas had been
  unsuccesful, by reason of the extraordinary fierceness and swiftness of
  these monstrous Animals; yet the enterprise being lately renewed, and
  such persons chosen and sent thither for the work, as were resolved not
  to be baffled by a Sea-monster, they did prosper so far in this
  undertaking, that, having been out at Sea, near the said Isle of
  <i>Bermudas</i>, seventeen times, and fastned their Weapons a dozen
  times, they killed in these expeditions 2 old Female-Whales, and 3 Cubs,
  whereof one of the old ones, from the head to the extremity of the Tayl,
  was 88. Foot in length, by measure; its Tayl being 23. Foot broad, the
  swimming Finn 26. Foot long, and the Gills three Foot long: having great
  bends underneath from the Nose to the Navil; upon her after-part, a Finn
  on the back; being within <!-- Page 12 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page12"></a>{12}</span>paved (this was the plain Sea-man's phrase)
  with fat, like the Cawl of a Hog.</p>

  <p>The other old one, he said, was some 60. Foot long. Of the Cubs, one
  was 33. the other two, much about 25 or 26. Foot long.</p>

  <p>The shape of the Fish, he said, was very sharp behind, like the ridge
  of a house; the head pretty bluff, and full of bumps on both sides; the
  back perfectly black, and the belly white.</p>

  <p>Their celerity and force he affirmed to be wonderful, insomuch that
  one of those Creatures, which he struck himself, towed the boat wherein
  he was, after him, for the space of six or seven Leagues, in ¾ of an
  hours time. Being wounded, he saith, they make a hideous roaring, at
  which, all of that kind that are within hearing, come towards that place,
  where the Animal is, yet without striking, or doing any harm to the
  wary.</p>

  <p>He added, that they struck one of a prodigious bigness, and by guess
  of above 100 foot long. He is of opinion, that this Fish comes nearest to
  that sort of Whales, which they call the <i>Jubartes</i>; they are
  without teeth, and longer than the <i>Greenland</i>-Whales, but not so
  thick.</p>

  <p>He said further, that they fed much upon Grass, growing at the bottom
  of the Sea; which, he affirmed, was seen by cutting up the great Bag of
  Maw, wherein he had found in one of them about two or three Hogsheads of
  a greenish grassy matter.</p>

  <p>As to the quantity and nature of the Oyl which they yield, he thought,
  that the largest sort of these Whales might afford seven or eight Tuns if
  well husbanded, although they had lost much this first time, for want of
  a good Cooper; having brought home but eleven Tuns. The Cubbs, by his
  relation, do yield but little, and that is but a kind of a Jelly. That
  which the old ones render, doth candy like Porks Grease, yet burneth very
  well. He observed, that the Oyl of the Blubber is as clear and fair as
  any Whey: but that which is boyled out of the Lean, interlarded, becomes
  as hard as Tallow, spattering in the burning and that which is made of
  the Cawl, resembleth Hoggs grease.</p>

  <p>One, but scarce credible, quality of this Oyl, he affirms to be, that
  though it be boiling, yet one may run ones hand into it without scalding;
  to which he adds, that it hath a very healing <!-- Page 13 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page13"></a>{13}</span>Vertue for cuttings,
  lameness, <i>&amp;c.</i>, the part affected being anointed therewith. One
  thing more he related, not to be omitted, which is, that having told,
  that the time of catching these Fishes was from the beginning of
  <i>March</i>, to the end of <i>May</i>, after which time they appeared no
  more in that part of the Sea: he did, when asked, whither they then
  retired, give this Answer, That it was thought, they went into the
  Weed-beds of the Gulf of <i>Florida</i>, it having been observed, that
  upon their Fins and Tails they have store of Clams or Barnacles, upon
  which, he said, Rock-weed or Sea-tangle did grow a hand long; many of
  them having been taken of them, of the bigness of great Oyster-shels, and
  hung upon the Governour of <i>Bermudas</i> his Pales.</p>

<h3><i>A Narrative concerning the success of Pendulum-Watches at
Sea for the Longitudes.</i></h3>

  <p>The Relation lately made by Major <i>Holmes</i>, concerning the
  success of the <i>Pendulum-Watches</i> at Sea (two whereof were committed
  to his Care and Observation in his last voyage to <i>Guiny</i> by some of
  our Eminent <i>Virtuosi</i>, and Grand Promoters of Navigation) is as
  followeth;</p>

  <p>The said <i>Major</i> having left that Coast, and being come to the
  Isle of St. <i>Thomas</i> under the <i>Line</i> accompanied with four
  Vessels, having there adjusted his Watches, put to Sea, and sailed
  Westward, seven or eight hundred Leagues, without changing his course;
  after which, finding the Wind favourable, he steered towards the Coast of
  <i>Africk</i>, North-North-East. But having sailed upon that <i>Line</i>
  a matter of two or three hundred Leagues, the Masters of the other Ships,
  under his Conduct, apprehending that they should want Water, before they
  could reach that Coast, did propose to him to steer their Course to the
  <i>Barbadoes</i>, to supply themselves with Water there. Whereupon the
  said Major, having called the Master and Pilots together, and caused them
  to produce their Journals and Calculations, it was found, that those
  Pilots did differ in their reckonings from that of the Major, one of them
  eighty Leagues, another about an hundred, and the third, more; but the
  Major judging by his <i>Pendulum-Watches</i>, that they were only some
  thirty Leagues distant from <!-- Page 14 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page14"></a>{14}</span>the Isle of <i>Fuego</i>, which is one of
  the Isles of <i>Cape Verde</i>, and that they might reach it next day,
  and having a great confidence in the said Watches, resolved to steer
  their Course thither, and having given order so to do, they got the very
  next day about Noon a sight of the said Isle of <i>Fuego</i>, finding
  themselves to sail directly upon it, and so arrived at it that Afternoon,
  as he had said. These Watches having been first Invented by the Excellent
  Monsieur <i>Christian Hugens</i> of <i>Zulichem</i>, and fitted to go at
  Sea, by the Right Honourable, the Earl of <i>Kincardin</i>, both Fellows
  of the <i>Royal Society</i>, are now brought by a New addition to a
  wonderful perfection. The said Monsieur <i>Hugens</i>, having been
  informed of the success of the Experiment, made by <i>Major Holmes</i>,
  wrought to a friend at <i>Paris</i> a Letter to this effect;</p>

  <p>Major <i>Holmes</i> at his return, hath made a relation concerning the
  usefulness of <i>Pendulums</i>, which surpasseth my expectation: I did
  not imagine that the Watches of this first Structure would succeed so
  well, and I had reserved my main hopes for the New ones. But seeing that
  those have already served so succesfully, and that the other are yet more
  just and exact, I have the more reason to believe, that the Invention of
  <i>Longitudes</i> will come to its perfection. In the mean time I shall
  tell you, that the <i>States</i> did receive my Proposition, when I
  desired of them a Patent for these new Watches, and the recompense set
  a-part for the invention in case of success; and that without any
  difficulty they have granted my request, commanding me to bring one of
  these Watches into their Assembly, to explicate unto them the Invention,
  and the application thereof to the <i>Longitudes</i>; which I have done
  to their contentment. I have this week published, that the said Watches
  shall be exposed to sale, together with an Information necessary to use
  them at Sea: and thus I have broken the Ice. The same Objection, that
  hath been made in your parts against the exactness of these
  <i>Pendulums</i>, hath also been made here; to wit, that though they
  should agree together, they might fail both of them, by reason that the
  Air at one time might be thicker, than at another. But I have answered,
  that this difference, if there be any, will not be at all perceived in
  the <i>Penduls</i>, seeing that the continuall Observations, made in
  Winter from day to day, until Summer, have shewed me that <!-- Page 15
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page15"></a>{15}</span>they have
  alwaies agreed with the Sun. As to the Printing of the <i>Figure</i> of
  my New Watch, I shall defer that yet a while: but it shall in time appear
  with all the Demonstrations thereof, together with a <i>Treatise</i> of
  <i>Pendulums</i>, written by me some daies since, which is of a very
  subtile Speculation.</p>

<h3><i>The Character, lately published beyond the Seas, of an Eminent
person, not long since dead at </i>Tholouse<i>, where he was a
Councellor of Parliament.</i></h3>

  <p>It is the deservedly famous <i>Mounsieur de Fermat</i>, who was,
  (saith the Author of the Letter) one of the most Excellent Men of this
  Age, a <i>Genius</i> so universal, and of so vast an extent, that if very
  knowing and learned Men had not given testimony of his extraordinary
  merit, what with truth can be said of him, would hardly be believed. He
  entertained a constant correspondence with many of the most Illustrious
  Mathematicians of <i>Europe</i>, and did excel in all the parts of
  Mathematical Science: a Testimony whereof he hath left behind him in the
  following Books.</p>

  <p>A Method for the Quadrature of <i>Parabola's</i> of all degrees.</p>

  <p>A Book <i>De Maximis &amp; Minimis</i>, which serveth not only for the
  determination of Problems of <i>Plains</i> and <i>Solids</i>, but also
  for the invention of <i>Tangents</i> and <i>Curve Lines</i>, and of the
  <i>Centres</i> of Gravity in Solids; and likewise for Numerical
  Questions.</p>

  <p>An Introduction to the Doctrine of <i>Plains</i> and <i>Solids</i>,
  which is an <i>Analytical</i> Treatise, concerning the solution of
  <i>Plains</i> and <i>Solids</i>, which has been seen (as the Advertiser
  affirms) before Monsieur <i>Des Cartes</i> had publish'd any thing upon
  this Subject.</p>

  <p>A Treatise <i>De Contactibus Sphæricis</i>, where he hath demonstrated
  in <i>Solids</i>, what Mr. <i>Viet</i>, Master of Requests, had but
  demonstrated in <i>Plains</i>.</p>

  <p>Another Treatise, wherein he establisheth and demonstrateth the two
  Books of <i>Apollonius Pergæus</i>, of <i>Plains</i>.</p>

  <p>And a General Method for the dimension of <i>Curve Lines</i>, &amp;c.
  Besides, having a perfect knowledge in Antiquity, he was consulted from
  all parts upon the difficulties that did emerg therein: he hath explained
  abundance of obscure places, that are <!-- Page 16 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page16"></a>{16}</span>found in the Antients.
  There have been lately printed some of his Observations upon
  <i>Athenæus</i>; and he that hath interpreted <i>Benedetto Castelli</i>,
  of the Measure of running waters, hath thence inserted in his Work a very
  handsome one upon an Epistle of <i>Synesius</i>, which was so difficult,
  that the Jesuit <i>Petavius</i>, who hath commented upon this Author,
  acknowledges, that he could not understand it.</p>

  <p>He hath also made many Observations upon <i>Theon of Smyrne</i>, and
  upon other Antient Authors: but most part of them are not found but
  scattered in his Epistles, because he did not write much upon these kinds
  of Subjects, but to satisfie the curiosity of his friends.</p>

  <p>All these Mathematical Works, and all these curious searches in
  Antiquity, did not hinder this great <i>Virtuoso</i> from discharging the
  duties of his place with much assiduity, and with so much ability, that
  he hath had the reputation of one of the greatest <i>Civilians</i> of his
  Age.</p>

  <p>But that, which is most of all surprizing to many, is, that with all
  that strength of understanding, which was requisite to make good these
  rare qualities, lately mentioned, he had so polite and delicate parts,
  that he composed <i>Latin</i>, <i>French</i>, and <i>Spanish</i> Verses
  with the same elegancy, as if he had lived in the time of
  <i>Augustus</i>, and passed the greatest part of his life at the Courts
  of <i>France</i> and <i>Spain</i>.</p>

  <p>More particulars will perhaps be mention'd of the Works of this Rare
  person, when all things, that he hath publish'd, shall be recovered, and
  when liberty shall be obtained of his Worthy Son, to impart unto the
  World the rest of his Writings, hitherto unpublished.</p>

<h3><i>Extract of a Letter, lately written from </i>Rome<i>, touching the
late Comet, and a New one.</i></h3>

  <p>I Cannot enough wonder at the strange agreement of the thoughts of
  that acute French Gentleman, Monsieur <i>Auzout</i>, in the
  <i>Hypothesis</i> of the Comets motion, with mine; and particularly, at
  that of the <i>Tables</i>. I have with the same method, whereby I find
  the motion of this Comet, easily found the Principle of that Author's
  <i>Ephemerides</i>, which he then thought not fit to declare; and 'tis
  this, that this Comet moves about the <i>Great Dog</i>, in so great a
  Circle, that that portion, which is <!-- Page 18 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page18"></a>{18}</span>described, is exceeding
  small in respect of the whole circumference thereof, and hardly
  distinguishable by us from a streight line.</p>

  <p>Concerning the New Comet you mention, I saw it on the 11. of
  <i>February</i>, about the 24. deg. of <i>Aries</i>, with a Northern
  latitude of 24. deg. 40. min. The cloudy weather hath not yet permitted
  me to see it in <i>Andromeda</i>, as others affirm to have done.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<h3><i>Extract of a Letter, written from </i>Paris<i>, containing some
Reflections on part of the precedent </i>Roman<i> Letter.</i></h3>

  <p>As to the <i>Hypothesis</i> of <i>Georg. Domenico Cassini</i>,
  touching the motion of the <i>Comet</i> about the <i>Great Dog</i> in a
  Circle, whose Centre is in a streight line drawn from the Earth through
  the said Star, I believe it will shortly be publish'd in print, as a
  thought I lighted upon in discoursing with one of my Friends, who did
  maintain, that it turned about a Centre, because that its <i>Perigee</i>
  had been over against the <i>Great Dog</i>, as I had noted in my
  <i>Ephemerides</i>. This particular I did long since declare to many of
  my acquaintance, whereof some or other will certainly do me that right,
  as to let the world know it by the Press. I have added an Observation,
  which I find not, that Signior <i>Cassini</i> hath made, <i>viz.</i> that
  there was ground to think, that the <i>Comet</i> of 1652. was the same
  with the present, seeing that besides the parity of the swiftness of its
  motion, the <i>Perigee</i> thereof was also over against the <i>Great
  Dog</i>, if the Observations extant thereof, deceive not. But, to make it
  out, what ground I had for these thoughts, I said, that if they were
  true, the Comet must needs acomplish its revolution from 10. to 12.
  years, or thereabout. But, seeing it appears not by History, that a Comet
  hath been seen at those determinate distances of time, nor that over
  against the <i>Perigee</i> of all the other Comets, whereof particular
  observations are recorded, are alwaies found Stars of the first
  Magnitude, or such others, as are very notable, besides other reasons,
  that might be alledged, I shall not pursue this speculation; but rather
  <!-- Page 19 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page19"></a>{19}</span>suggest what I have taken notice of in my
  reflexions upon former Comets, which is, that more of them enter inter
  our Systeme by the sign of <i>Libra</i> and about <i>Spica virginis</i>,
  than by all the other parts of the Heavens. For, both the present Comet,
  and many others registred in History, have entred that way, and
  consequently passed out of it by the sign <i>Aries</i>, by which also
  many have entred.</p>

  <p>I did found my <i>Hypothesis</i> upon three Observations only,
  <i>viz.</i> those of the 22, 26, and 31. of <i>December</i>. Nor have I
  done, as some have fancied of me, who having been able to observe the
  Comet, the 27, 28, 29, 30, and 31. of <i>December</i>, and to see the
  diminution of its motion, have judged, that I had only determined that
  diminution for the time to come, conform to the augmentation thereof in
  time passed until the 29. of <i>December</i>. For <i>January</i> 1. (on
  which day I composed my <i>Ephemerides</i>) I knew not (nor any person
  here) that the motion of the Comet did diminish; but on the contrary,
  most men believed, it was not the same Comet. But Signior <i>Cassini</i>
  knows very well, that that was not necessary, seeing that two portions of
  a <i>Tangent</i> being given, and the <i>Angles</i> answering thereunto,
  'tis easie to find the position and magnitude of its Circle. The reason,
  which I think the true one, of the diminution of its Motion in Longitude,
  and of its Retrogradation, by me conjectured in my <i>Ephemerides</i>, I
  began to be assured of, <i>Febr.</i> 10. For until the sixth, the Comet
  had alwaies advanced, as Signior <i>Cassini</i> also hath very well
  noted: but after that day, I found that it returned in augmenting alwaies
  its Latitude. And I have constantly observed it, until <i>March</i> 8.
  between many Stars, which must be the same with these mentioned by
  <i>Cassini</i>, whereof the number was so great, that I think, I saw of
  them <i>March</i> 6. with one <i>Aperture</i> of my Glass, more than 40.
  or 50. and especially, above the head of <i>Aries</i>; but I did not
  particularly note the scituation of more than 12. or 15; amongst which I
  have observed the position of the Comet since <i>January</i> 28. every
  day, when the weather did permit, <i>viz.</i> <i>January</i> 29.
  <i>February</i> 3, 6, 10, 17, 19, 24, 26, 27. and <i>March</i> 6, <!--
  Page 20 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page20"></a>{20}</span>7, 8. I
  left it on <i>March</i> 8. at the 18. of the Horn of <i>Aries</i>, almost
  in the same latitude: and I am apt to believe, it will be Eclipsed, which
  I wish I may be able to observe this evening, if it be not already
  passed.</p>

  <p>If Signior <i>Cassini</i> hath observed it on those daies that I have,
  he will be glad to find the conformity of our Observations. I shall only
  add, that on <i>February</i> 3. we were surprized, to see the Comet again
  much brighter than ordinary, and with a considerable Train. Some did
  believe, that it approach'd again to us. But having beheld it with a
  <i>Telescope</i>, I soon said, that it was joyned with two small Stars,
  whereof one was pretty bright, which I had already seen, on
  <i>February</i> 28. and 29. And this conjunction gave the <i>Comet</i>
  that brightness, as it happens to most of the Stars of the fifth and
  sixth magnitude, where 2. or 3. or more are conjoyned, which perhaps
  would shew but faintly single, though by reason of their proximity to one
  another, they appear but one Star. Hence it was, that I assured my
  friends here, that the following daies we should no more see it so
  bright, because I knew, that there were none such small bright Stars in
  the way, which by my former observations I conjectured it was to
  move.</p>

<h3><i>An Observation imparted to the Noble Mr. </i>Boyle<i>, by
Mr. </i>David Thomas<i>, touching some particulars further
considerable in the Monster mentioned in the first Papers
of these </i>Philosophical Transactions<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>Upon the strictest inquiry, I find by one, that saw the Monstrous Calf
  and stone, within four hours after it was cut out of the Cows belly, that
  the Breast of the Calf was not stony (as I wrote) but that the skin of
  the Breast and between the Legs and of the Neck (which parts lay on the
  smaller end of the stone) was very much thicker, than on any other part,
  and that the Feet of the Calf were so parted as to be like the Claws of a
  Dog. The stone I have since seen; it is bigger at one end <!-- Page 21
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page21"></a>{21}</span>than the other;
  of no plain <i>Superficies</i>, but full of little cavities. The stone,
  when broken, is full of small peble stones of an Ovall figure: its colour
  is gray like free-stone, but intermixt with veins of yellow and black. A
  part of it I have begg'd of Dr. <i>Haughten</i> for you, which I have
  sent to <i>Oxford</i>, whither a more exact account will be conveyed by

<h3><i>Extract of a Letter, lately written from </i>Venice<i> by the
Learned Doctor </i>Walter Pope<i>, to the Reverend Dean of
</i>Rippon<i>, Doctor </i>John Wilkins<i>, concerning the Mines
of Mercury in </i>Friuli<i>; and a way of producing </i>Wind<i>
by the fall of </i>Water<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>The mines of <i>Mercury</i> in <i>Friuli</i>, a Territory belonging to
  the <i>Venetians</i>, are about a days Journey and a half distant from
  <i>Goritia</i> Northwards, at a place call'd <i>Idria</i>, scituated in a
  Valley of the <i>Julian Alps</i>. They have been, as I am inform'd, these
  160. years in the possession of the Emperor, and all the Inhabitants
  speak the <i>Sclavonian</i> Tongue. In going thither, we travell'd
  several hours in the best Wood I ever saw before or since, being very
  full of <i>Firrs</i>, <i>Oakes</i>, and <i>Beeches</i>, of an
  extraordinary thickness, straitness, and height. The Town is built, as
  usually Towns in the <i>Alps</i> are, all of wood, the Church only
  excepted, and another House wherein the Overseer liveth. When I was
  there, in <i>August</i> last, the Valley, and the Mountains too, out of
  which the <i>Mercury</i> was dug, were of as pleasant a verdure, as if it
  had been in the midst of Spring, which they there attribute to the
  moistness of the <i>Mercury</i>; how truly, I dispute not. That Mine,
  which we went into, the best and greatest of them all, was dedicated to
  Saint <i>Barbara</i>, as the other Mines are to other Saints, the depth
  of it was 125. paces, every pace of that Country being, as they inform'd
  us, more than 5 of our Feet. There are two ways down to it; the shortest
  perpendicular way is that, whereby they bring up the Mineral in great
  Buckets, and <!-- Page 22 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page22"></a>{22}</span>by which oftentimes some of the workmen come
  up and down. The other, which is the usual way, is at the beginning not
  difficult, the descent not being much; the greatest trouble is, that in
  several places you cannot stand upright: but this holds not long, before
  you come to descend in earnest by perpendicular Ladders, where the weight
  of on's body is found very sensible. At the end of each Ladder, there are
  boards a-cross, where we may breath a little. The Ladders, as we said,
  are perpendicular, but being imagined produced, do not make one Ladder,
  but several parallel ones. Being at the bottom, we saw no more than we
  saw before, only the place, whence the Mineral came. All the way down,
  and the bottom, where there are several lanes cut out in the Mountain, is
  lined and propt with great pieces of Firr-trees, as thick as they can be
  set. They dig the Mineral with Pick-axes, following the veins: 'tis for
  the most part hard as a stone, but more weighty; of a Liver-colour, or
  that of <i>Crocus Metallorum</i>. I hope shortly to shew you some of it.
  There is also some soft Earth, in which you plainly see the
  <i>Mercury</i> in little particles. Besides this, there are oftentimes
  found in the Mines round stones like Flints, of several bignesses, very
  like those Globes of Hair, which I have often seen in <i>England</i>,
  taken out of Oxes bellies. There are also several <i>Marcasites</i> and
  stones, which seem to have specks of Gold in them, but upon tryal they
  say, they find none in them. These round stones are some of them very
  ponderous, and well impregnated with <i>Mercury</i>; others light, having
  little or none in them. The manner of getting the <i>Mercury</i> is this:
  They take of the Earth, brought up in Buckets, and put it into a Sive,
  whose bottom is made of wires at so great a distance, that you may put
  your finger betwixt them: 'tis carried to a stream of running water, and
  wash'd as long as any thing will pass through the Sive. That Earth which
  passeth not, is laid aside upon another heap: that which passeth,
  reserved in the hole, G. in Fig. 1. and taken up again by the second Man,
  and so on, to about ten or twelve sives proportionably less. It often
  happens in the first hole, where the second Man takes up his <!-- Page 23
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page23"></a>{23}</span>Earth, that
  there is <i>Mercury</i> at the bottom; but towards the farther end, where
  the Intervals of the wires are less, 'tis found in very great proportion.
  The Earth laid aside is pounded, and the same operation repeated. The
  fine small Earth, that remains after this, and out of which they can wash
  no more <i>Mercury</i>, is put into Iron retorts and stopt, because it
  should not fall into the Receivers, to which they are luted. The fire
  forces the <i>Mercury</i> into the Receivers: the Officer unluted several
  of them to shew us; I observed in all of them, that he first poured out
  perfect <i>Mercury</i>, and after that came a black dust, which being
  wetted with water discover'd it self to be <i>Mercury</i>, as the other
  was. They take the <i>Caput mortuum</i> and pound it, and renew the
  operation as long as they can get any <i>Mercury</i> out of it.</p>

  <p>This is the way of producing the <i>Mercury</i>, they call
  <i>Ordinary</i>, which exceeds that, which is got by washing, in a very
  great proportion, as you will perceive by the account annext. All the
  <i>Mercury</i> got without the use of Fire, whether by washing, or found
  in the Mines (for in the digging, some little particles get together, so
  that in some places you might take up two or three spoonfuls of pure
  <i>Mercury</i>) is call'd by them <i>Virgin Mercury</i>, and esteem'd
  above the rest. I inquir'd of the Officer what vertue that had more, than
  the other; he told me that making an <i>Amalgama</i> of Gold and
  <i>Virgin Mercury</i>, and putting it to the fire, that <i>Mercury</i>
  would carry away all the Gold with it, which common <i>Mercury</i> would
  not do.</p>

  <p>The Engins, employed in these Mines, are admirable; the Wheels, the
  greatest that ever I saw in my life; one would think as great as the
  matter would bear: all moved by the dead force of the water, brought
  thither in no chargeable Aqueduct from a Mountain, 3 Miles distant: the
  water pumpt from the bottom of the Mine by 52 pumps, 26 on a side, is
  contrived to move other wheels, for several other purposes.</p>

  <p>The Labourers work for a <i>Julio</i> a day, which is not above 6 or 7
  pence, and indure not long; for, although none stay <!-- Page 24 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page24"></a>{24}</span>underground above 6
  hours; all of them in time (some later, some sooner) become
  <i>paralitick</i>, and dye <i>hectick</i>.</p>

  <p>We saw there a man, who had not been in the Mines for above half a
  year before, so full of <i>Mercury</i>, that putting a piece of
  <i>Brass</i> in his mouth, or rubbing it in his fingers, it immediately
  became white like Silver: I mean he did the same effect, as if he had
  rubb'd <i>Mercury</i> upon it, and so paralitick, that he could not with
  both his hands carry a Glass, half full of Wine, to his mouth without
  spilling it, though he loved it too well to throw it away.</p>

  <p>I have been since informed, that here in <i>Venice</i>, those that
  work on the back-side of Looking-glasses, are also very subject to the
  <i>Palsey</i>. I did not observe, that they had black Teeth; it may be
  therefore, that we accuse <i>Mercury</i> injustly for spoiling the Teeth,
  when given in <i>Venereal</i> diseases. I confess, I did not think of it
  upon the place; but, black Teeth being so very rare in this Country, I
  think I could not but have markt it, had all theirs been so.</p>

  <p>They use exceeding great quantity of Wood, in making and repairing the
  Engins, and in the Furnaces (whereof there are 16. each of them carrying
  24. Retorts;) but principally in the Mines, which need continual
  reparation, the Fir-trees lasting but a small time under ground. They
  convey their Wood thus: About four miles from the Mines, on the sides of
  two mountains, they cut down the Trees, and draw them into the
  interjacent Valley, higher in the same Valley, so that the Trees,
  according to the descent of the water lye betwixt it and <i>Idria</i>:
  with vast charges and quantities of Wood they made a Lock or Dam, that
  suffers not any water to pass; they expect afterwards till there be water
  enough to float these Trees to <i>Idria</i>; for, if there be not a
  spring, (as generally there is,) Rain, or the melting of the Snow, in a
  short time, afford so much water, as is ready to run over the Dam, and
  which (the Flood-gates being open'd) carries all the Trees impetuously to
  <i>Idria</i>, where the Bridge is built very strong, and at very oblique
  Angles to the stream, on purpose to stop them, and throw them on shore
  neer the Mines. <!-- Page 25 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page25"></a>{25}</span></p>

  <p>Those Mines cost the <i>Emperour</i> heretofore 70000. or 80000.
  <i>Florens</i> yearly, and yielded less <i>Mercury</i> than at present,
  although it costs him but 28000. <i>Florens</i> now. You may see what his
  Imperial Majesty gets by the following account, of what <i>Mercury</i>
  the Mines of <i>Idria</i> have produced these last three years.</p>

  <p>I will trespass a little more upon you, in describing the contrivance
  of blowing the Fire in the <i>Brassworks</i> of <i>Tivoli</i> neer
  <i>Rome</i> (it being new to me) where the Water blows the Fire, not by
  moving the Bellows, (which is common) but by affording the Wind. See Fig.

  the Tub into which it falls, <i>LG.</i> a Pipe, <i>G.</i> the orifice of
  the Pipe, or Nose of the Bellows, <i>GK.</i> the Hearth, <i>E.</i> a hole
  in the Pipe, <i>F.</i> a stopper to that hole, <i>D.</i> a place under
  ground, by which the water runs away. Stopping the hole <i>E</i>, there
  is a perpetual strong wind, issuing forth at <i>G</i>: and <i>G.</i>
  being stopt, the wind comes out so vehemently at <i>E</i>, that it will,
  I believe, make a Ball play, like that at <i>Frescati</i>.</p>

<h3><i>An Extract of a Letter, containing some Observations,
made in the ordering of </i>Silk-worms<i>, communicated
by that known </i>Vertuoso<i>, Mr. </i>Dudley Palmer<i>, from
the ingenuous Mr. </i>Edward Digges<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>I herewith offer to your <i>Society</i> a small parcel of my
  <i>Virginian</i> Silk. What I have observed in the ordering of
  Silk-worms, contrary to the received opinion, is:</p>

  <p>1. That I have kept leaves 24. hours after they are gathered, and
  flung water upon them to keep them from withering; yet when (without
  wiping the leaves) I fed the worms, I observed, they did as well as those
  fresh gathered.</p>

  <p>2. I never observed, that the smell of <i>Tobacco</i>, or smels that
  are rank, did any waies annoy the worm.</p>

  <p>3. Our country of <i>Virginia</i> is very much subject to Thunders:
  and it hath thundered exceedingly when I have had worms of all sorts,
  some newly hatched; some half way in their feeding; others spinning their
  Silk; yet I found none of them concern'd in the Thunder, but kept to
  their business, as if there had been no such thing.</p>

  <p>4. I have made many bottoms of the Brooms (wherein hundreds of worms
  spun) of <i>Holly</i>; and the prickles were so far from hurting them,
  that even from those prickles they first began to make their bottoms.</p>

  <p>I did hope with this to have given you assurance, that by retarding
  the hatching of seed, two crops of silk or more <!-- Page 27 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page27"></a>{27}</span>might be made in a
  Summer: but my servants have been remiss in what was ordered, I must
  crave your patience till next year.</p>

<h3><i>An account of </i>Micrographia<i>, or the </i>Physiological
Descriptions<i> of </i>Minute Bodies<i>, made by </i>Magnifying
Glasses<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>The Ingenious and knowing Author of this <i>Treatise</i>, Mr.
  <i>Robert Hook</i>, considering with himself, of what importance a
  faithful <i>History of Nature</i> is to the establishing of a solid
  Systeme of <i>Natural Philosophy</i>, and what advantage
  <i>Experimental</i> and <i>Mechanical</i> knowledge hath over the
  Philosophy of <i>discourse</i> and <i>disputation</i>, and making it,
  upon that account, his constant business to bring into that vast Treasury
  what portion he can, hath lately published a Specimen of his abilities in
  this kind of study, which certainly is very welcome to the Learned and
  Inquisitive world, both for the <i>New discoveries</i> in <i>Nature</i>,
  and the <i>New Inventions</i> of <i>Art</i>.</p>

  <p>As to the <i>former</i>, the Attentive Reader of this Book will find,
  that there being hardly any thing so small, as by the help of
  <i>Microscopes</i>, to escape our enquiry, a new visible world is
  discovered by this means, and the Earth shews quite a new thing to us, so
  that in every <i>little particle</i> of its matter, we may now behold
  almost as great a variety of creatures, as we were able before to reckon
  up in the whole <i>Universe</i> it self. Here our Author maketh it not
  improbable, but that, by these helps the subtilty of the composition of
  Bodies, the structure of their parts, the various texture of their
  matter, the instruments and manner of their inward motions, and all the
  other appearances of things, may be more fully discovered; whence may
  emerge many admirable advantages towards the enlargement of the
  <i>Active</i> and <i>Mechanick</i> part of knowledge, because we may
  perhaps be enabled to discern the secret <!-- Page 28 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page28"></a>{28}</span>workings of
  <i>Nature</i>, almost in the same manner, as we do those that are the
  productions of <i>Art</i>, and are managed by <i>Wheels</i>, and
  <i>Engines</i>, and <i>Springs</i>, that were devised by Humane wit. To
  this end, he hath made a very curious <i>Survey</i> of all kinds of
  bodies, beginning with the <i>Point of a Needle</i>, and proceeding to
  the <i>Microscopical</i> view of the <i>Edges</i> of <i>Rasors, Fine
  Lawn, Tabby, Watered Silks, Glass-canes, Glass-drops, Fiery Sparks,
  Fantastical Colours, Metalline Colours, the Figures of Sand, Gravel in
  Urine, Diamonds in Flints, Frozen Figures, the Kettering Stone, Charcoal,
  Wood and other Bodies petrified, the Pores of Cork, and of other
  substances, Vegetables growing on blighted Leaves, Blew mould and
  Mushromes, Sponges, and other Fibrous Bodies, Sea-weed, the Surfaces of
  some Leaves, the stinging points of a Nettle, Cowage, the Beard of a wild
  Oate, the seed of the Corn-violet, as also of Tyme, Poppy and
  Purslane.</i> He continues to describe <i>Hair, the scales of a Soal, the
  sting of a Bee, Feathers</i> in general, and in particular those of
  <i>Peacocks; the feet of Flies; and other Insects; the Wings and Head of
  a Fly; the Teeth of a Snail; the Eggs of Silk-worms; the Blue Fly; a
  water Insect; the Tufted Gnat; a White Moth; the Shepheards-spider; the
  Hunting Spider, the Ant; the wandring Mite; the Crab-like insect, the
  Book-worm, the Flea, the Louse, Mites, Vine mites.</i> He concludeth with
  taking occasion to discourse of two or three very considerable subjects,
  viz. <i>The inflexion of the Rays of Lights in the Air; the Fixt stars;
  the Moon.</i></p>

  <p>In representing these particulars to the Readers view, the Author hath
  not only given proof of his singular skil in delineating all sorts of
  Bodies (he having drawn all the <i>Schemes</i> of these 60
  <i>Microscopical</i> objects with his own hand) and of his extraordinary
  care of having them so curiously engraven by the Masters of that Art; but
  he hath also suggested in the several reflexions, made upon these
  Objects, such conjectures, as are likely to excite and quicken the
  Philosophical heads to very noble contemplations. Here are found
  inquiries concerning the <i>Propagation of Light</i> through <!-- Page 29
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page29"></a>{29}</span>differing
  mediums; concerning <i>Gravity</i>, concerning the <i>Roundness</i> of
  Fruits, stones, and divers artificial bodies; concerning
  <i>Springiness</i> and <i>Tenacity</i>; concerning the <i>Original</i> of
  <i>Fountains</i>; concerning the <i>dissolution of Bodies into
  Liquors</i>; concerning <i>Filtration</i>, and the ascent of Juices in
  Vegetables, and the use of their <i>Pores</i>. Here an attempt is made of
  solving the strange <i>Phænomena</i> of <span class="correction"
  title="Original reads `Grass-drops'."><i>Glass-drops</i></span>;
  experiments are alleged to prove the <i>Expansion</i> of <i>Glass</i> by
  heat, and the <i>Contraction</i> of <i>heated-Glass</i> upon cooling;
  <i>Des Cartes</i> his <i>Hypothesis of Colours</i> is examined: the
  <i>cause of Colours</i>, most likely to the Author, is explained: Reasons
  are produced, that <i>Reflection</i> is not necessary to produce
  <i>colours</i>, nor a <i>double refraction</i>: some considerable
  <i>Hypotheses</i> are <i>offered</i>, for the explication of Light by
  Motion; for the producing of all colours by Refraction; for reducing all
  sorts of colours to two only, <i>Yellow</i> and <i>Blew</i>; for making
  the <i>Air</i>, a dissolvent of all <i>Combustible Bodies</i>: and for
  the explicating of all the regular figures of <i>Salt</i>, where he
  alleges many notable instances of the <i>Mathematicks</i> of
  <i>Nature</i>, as having even in those things which we account vile, rude
  &amp; course, shewed abundance of curiosity and excellent <i>Geometry</i>
  and <i>Mechanism</i>. And here he opens a large field for inquiries, and
  proposeth Models for prosecuting them, 1. By making a full collection of
  all the differing kinds of <i>Geometricall</i> figur'd bodies; 2. By
  getting with them an exact History of their places where they are
  generated or found: 3. By making store of Tryals in Dissolutions and
  Coagulations of several Crystallizing Salts: 4. By making trials on
  metalls, Minerals and Stones, by dissolving them in severall
  <i>Menstruums</i>, and Crystallizing them, to see what Figures will arise
  from those several compositums: 5. By compounding &amp; coagulating
  several Salts together into the same mass, to observe the Figure of that
  product: 6. By inquiring the closenes or rarity of the texture of those
  bodys by examining their gravity, and their refraction, &amp;c. 7. By
  examining what operations the fire hath upon several kinds of Salts, what
  changes it causes in their figures, Textures, or <!-- Page 30 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page30"></a>{30}</span>Vertues. 8. By examining
  their manner of dissolution, or acting upon those bodies dissoluble in
  them and the Texture of those bodies before and after the process. 9. By
  considering, by what and how many means, such and such figures, actions
  and effects could be produced, and which of them might be the most
  likely, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>He goes on to offer his thoughts about the Pores of bodies, and a
  <i>kind</i> of <i>Valves</i> in wood; about spontaneous generation
  arising from the Putrefaction of bodies; about the nature of the
  Vegetation of mold, mushromes, moss, spunges; to the last of which he
  scarce finds any Body like it in texture. He adds, from the naturall
  contrivance, that is found in the leaf of a Nettle, how the stinging pain
  is created, and thence takes occasion to discourse of the poysoning of
  Darts. He subjoyns a curious description of the shape, <i>Mechanism</i>
  and use of the <i>sting</i> of a <i>Bee</i>; and shews the admirable
  Providence of Nature in the contrivance and fabrick of <i>Feathers</i>
  for Flying. He delivers those particulars about the Figure, parts and use
  of the head, feet, and wings of a Fly, that are not common. He observes
  the various wayes of the generations of Insects, and discourses
  handsomely of the means, by which they seem to act so prudently. He
  taketh notice of the <i>Mechanical</i> reason of the <i>Spider's</i>
  Fabrick, and maketh pretty Observations on the hunting Spider, and other
  Spiders and their Webs. And what he notes of a Flea, Louse, Mites, and
  Vinegar-worms, cannot but exceedingly please the curious Reader.</p>

  <p>Having dispatched these Matters, the Author offers his Thoughts for
  the explicating of many <i>Phænomena</i> of the Air, from the
  <i>Inflexion</i>, or from a <i>Multiplicate Refraction</i> of the rays of
  Light within the Body of the <i>Atmosphere</i>, and not from a
  <i>Refraction</i> caused by any terminating <i>superficies</i> of the Air
  above, nor from any such exactly defin'd <i>superficies</i> within the
  body of the <i>Atmosphere</i>; which conclusion he grounds upon this,
  that a <i>medium</i>, whose parts are unequally <i>dense</i>, and mov'd
  by various motions and transpositions as to one another, will produce all
  these <!-- Page 31 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page31"></a>{31}</span>visible effects upon the rays of Light,
  without any other <i>coefficient</i> cause: and then, that there is in
  the Air or <i>Atmosphere, such</i> a variety in the constituent parts of
  it, both as to their <i>density</i> and <i>rarity</i>, and as to their
  divers mutations and positions one to another.</p>

  <p>He concludeth with two <i>Celestial Observations</i>; whereof the
  <i>one</i> imports, what multitudes of Stars are discoverable by the
  <i>Telescope</i>, and the variety of their magnitudes; intimating with
  all, that the longer the Glasses are, and the bigger apertures they will
  indure, the more fit they are for these discoveries: the <i>other</i>
  affords a description of a <i>Vale</i> in the <i>Moon</i>, compared with
  that of <i>Hevelius</i> and <i>Ricciolo</i>; where the Reader will find
  several curious and pleasant Annotations, about the Pits of the
  <i>Moon</i>, and the Hills and Coverings of the same; as also about the
  variations in the <i>Moon</i>, and its <i>gravitating</i> principle,
  together with the use, that may be made of this Instance of a gravity in
  the <i>Moon</i>.</p>

  <p>As to the <i>Inventions of Art</i>, described in this Book, the
  curious Reader will there find these following:</p>

  <p>1. A <i>Baroscope</i>, or an Instrument to shew all the Minute
  Variations in the <i>Pressure of the Air</i>; by which he affirms, that
  he finds, that before and during the time of rainy weather, the Pressure
  of the Air is less; and in dry weather, but especially when an
  <i>Easterly</i> Wind (which having past over vast Tracts of Land, is
  heavy with earthy particles) blows, it is much more, though these changes
  be varied according to very odd Laws.</p>

  <p>2. A <i>Hygroscope</i>, or an Instrument, whereby the <i>Watery
  steams</i>, volatile in the Air, are discerned, which the Nose it self is
  not able to find. Which is by him fully described in the Observation
  touching the <i>Beard of a wild Oate</i>, by the means whereof this
  Instrument is contrived.</p>

  <p>3. An Instrument for <i>graduating Thermometers</i>, to make them
  <i>Standards</i> of <i>Heat</i> and <i>Cold</i>.</p>

  <p>4. A <i>New Engine</i> for <i>Grinding Optick Glasses</i>, by means of
  which he hopes, that any Spherical Glasses, of what length <!-- Page 32
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page32"></a>{32}</span>soever, may be
  speedily made: which seems to him most easie, because, if it succeeds,
  with one and the same Tool may be ground an <i>Object Glass</i> of any
  length or breadth requisite, and that with very little or no trouble in
  fitting the <i>Engine</i>, and without much skill in the <i>Grinder</i>.
  He thinks it very exact, because to the very last stroke the Glass does
  regulate and rectifie the <i>Tool</i> to its exact Figure; and the longer
  or more the <i>Tool</i> and <i>Glass</i> are wrought together, the more
  exact will both of them be of the desired Figure. He affirms further,
  that the motions of the Glass and Tool do so cross each other, that there
  is not one point of eithers surface, but hath thousands of cross motions
  thwarting it, so that there can be no kind of <i>Rings</i> or
  <i>Gutters</i> made, either in the <i>Tool</i> or <i>Glass</i>.</p>

  <p>5. A <i>New Instrument</i>, by which the <i>Refraction</i> of all
  kinds of Liquors may be exactly measured, thereby to give the Curious an
  opportunity of making Trials of that kind, to establish the <i>Laws</i>
  of <i>Refraction</i>, to wit, whether the <i>Sines of the Angles of
  Refraction are respectively proportionable to the Sines of the Angles of
  Incidence:</i> This Instrument being very proper to examine very
  accurately, and with little trouble, and in small quantities, the
  <i>Refraction</i> of any Liquor, not only for <i>one</i> inclination, but
  for <i>all</i>; whereby he is enabled to make accurate <i>Tables</i>. By
  the same also he affirms to have found it true, that what
  <i>proportion</i> the <i>Sine</i> of the Angle of the one
  <i>inclination</i> has to the <i>Sine</i> of its Angle of
  <i>Refraction</i>, correspondent to it, the same proportion have all the
  other <i>Sines</i> of Inclination to their respective <i>Sines</i> of
  <i>Refractions</i>.</p>

  <p>Lastly, this Author despairs not that there may be found many
  Mechanical Inventions, to improve our Senses of <i>Hearing, Smelling,
  Tasting, Touching</i>, as well as we have improved that of <i>Seeing</i>
  by <i>Optick Glasses</i>.</p>

<h3><i>Some Observations and Experiments upon
</i>May-Dew<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>That ingenious and inquisitive Gentleman, Master <i>Thomas
  Henshaw</i>, having had occasion to make use of a great quantity of
  <i>May-dew</i>, did, by several casual Essayes on that Subject, make the
  following Observations and Tryals, and present them to the <i>Royal
  Society</i>. <!-- Page 34 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page34"></a>{34}</span></p>

  <p>That <i>Dew</i> newly gathered and filtred through a clean Linnen
  cloth, though it be not very clear, is of a yellowish Colour, somewhat
  approaching to that of Urine.</p>

  <p>That having endevoured to putrefy it by putting several proportions
  into Glass bodies with blind heads, and setting them in several heats, as
  of dung, and gentle baths, he quite failed of his intention: for heat,
  though never so gentle, did rather clarify, and preserve it sweet, though
  continued for two moneths together, then cause any putrefaction or
  separation of parts.</p>

  <p>That exposing of it to the Sun for a whole Summer in Glasses, that
  hold about two Gallons, with narrow mouths, that might be stopp'd with
  Cork, the only considerable alteration, he observed to be produced in it,
  was, that Store of green stuff (such as is seen in Summer in ditches and
  standing waters) floated on the top, and in some places, grew to the
  sides of the Glass.</p>

  <p>That putting four or five Gallons of it into a half Tub, as they call
  it, of Wood, and straining a Canvas over it, to keep out Dust and
  Insects, and letting it stand in some shady room for three weeks or a
  month, it did of itself putrefy and stink exceedingly, and let fall to
  the bottom a black sediment like Mudd.</p>

  <p>That, coming often to see, what Alterations appeared in the
  putrefaction, He observed, that at the beginning, within twenty four
  hours, a slimy film floated on the top of the water, which after a while
  falling to the bottom, there came another such film in its place.</p>

  <p>That if <i>Dew</i> were put into a long narrow Vessel of Glass, such
  as formerly were used for Receivers in distilling of <i>Aqua Fortis</i>,
  the slime would rise to that height, that He could take it off with a
  Spoon; and when he had put a pretty quantity of it into a drinking Glass,
  and that it had stood all night, and the water dreined from it, if He had
  turned it out of his hand, it would stand upright in figure of the Glass,
  in substance like boyled white Starch, though something more transparent,
  if his memory (<i>saith he</i>) fail him not.</p>

  <p>That having once gotten a pretty quantity of this gelly, and put it
  into a Glass body and Blind-head, He set it into a gentle <!-- Page 35
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page35"></a>{35}</span>Bath with an
  intention to have putrefied it, but after a few days He found, the head
  had not been well luted on, and that some moisture exhaling, the gelly
  was grown almost dry, and a large <i>Mushrom</i> grown out of it within
  the Glass. It was of a loose watrish contexture, such an one, as he had
  seen growing out of rotten wood.</p>

  <p>That having several Tubs with good quantity of <i>Dew</i> in them, set
  to putrefy in the manner abovesaid, and comming to pour out of one of
  them to make use of it, He found in the water a great bunch, bigger than
  his fist, of those Insects commonly called <i>Hog-lice</i> or
  <i>Millepedes</i>, tangled together by their long tailes, one of which
  came out of every one of their bodies, about the bigness of a Horsehair:
  The Insects did all live and move after they were taken out.</p>

  <p>That emptying another Tub, whereon the Sun, it seems, had used
  sometimes to shine, and finding, upon the straining it through a clean
  linnen cloth, two or three spoonfulls of green stuff, though not so thick
  nor so green as that above mentioned, found in the Glasses
  <i>purposely</i> exposed to the Sun, He put this green stuff in a Glass,
  and tyed a paper over it, and coming some dayes after to view it, He
  found the Glass almost filled with an innumerable Company of small Flyes,
  almost all wings, such as are usually seen in great Swarms in the Aire in
  Summer Evenings.</p>

  <p>That setting about a Gallon of this <i>Dew</i> (which, he saith, if he
  misremember not, had been first putrefied and strained) in an open
  Jarre-Glass with a wide mouth, and leaving it for many weeks standing in
  a South-window, on which the Sun lay very much, but the Casements were
  kept close shut; after some time coming to take account of his
  <i>Dew</i>, He found it very full of little Insects with great Heads and
  small tapering Bodies, somewhat resembling Tadpoles, but very much less.
  These, on his approach to the Glass, would sink down to the bottom, as it
  were to hide themselves, and upon his retreat wrigle themselves up to the
  top of the water again. Leaving it thus for some time longer, He
  afterwards found the room very full of Gnats, though the Door and Windows
  were kept shut. He adds, that He did not at first suspect, that those
  Gnats had any <!-- Page 36 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page36"></a>{36}</span>relation to the <i>Dew</i>, but after
  finding the Gnats to be multiplied and the little watry Animals to be
  much lessened in quantity, and finding great numbers of their empty skins
  floating on the face of his <i>Dew</i>, He thought, he had just reason to
  perswade himself, the Gnats were by a second Birth produced of those
  little Animals.</p>

  <p>That vapouring away great quantities of his putrefied <i>Dew</i> in
  Glass Basons, and other Earthen glased Vessels, He did at last obtain, as
  he remembers, above two pound of <i>Grayish Earth</i>, which when he had
  washed with more of the same <i>Dew</i> out of all his Basons into one,
  and vapoured to siccity, lay in leaves one above another, not unlike to
  some kind of brown Paper, but very friable.</p>

  <p>That taking this Earth out, and after he had well ground it on a
  Marble, and given it a smart Fire, in a coated Retort of Glass, it soon
  melted and became a Cake in the bottom, when it was cold, and looked as
  if it had been Salt and Brimstone in a certain proportion melted
  together; but, as he remembers, was not at all inflamable. This ground
  again on a Marble, <i>he saith</i>, did turn Spring water of a reddish
  purple Colour.</p>

  <p>That by often calcining and filtring this Earth, He did at last
  extract about two ounces of a fine small <i>white Salt</i>, which, looked
  on through a good <i>Microscope</i>, seemed to have Sides and Angles in
  the same number and figure, as <i>Rochpeeter</i>.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<h3><i>The Motion of the </i>Second<i> Comet predicted, by
the same Gentleman, who predicted that of the </i>former<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>Monsieur <i>Auzout</i>, the same Person, that not long since
  communicated to the World his <i>Ephemerides</i> touching the course of
  the former <i>Comet</i>, and recommended several Copies of them to the
  <i>Royal Society</i>, to compare their Observations with his Account, and
  thereby, either to verifie his Predictions, or to shew, wherein they
  differ, hath lately sent another <i>Ephemerides</i> concerning the Motion
  of the Second <i>Comet</i>, to the same end, that invited him to send the
  other. <!-- Page 37 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page37"></a>{37}</span></p>

  <p>In that Tract he observes, first in <i>General</i>, that this second
  <i>Comet</i> is contrary to the precedent, almost in all particulars:
  seeing that the <i>former</i> moved very swift, <i>this</i>, pretty slow;
  <i>that</i> against the Order of the signs from East to West,
  <i>this</i>, following them, from West to East: <i>that</i>, from South
  to North, <i>this</i>, from North to South, as far as it hath been
  hitherto, that we hear off, observed: <i>that</i>, on the side opposite
  to the Sun, <i>this</i>, on the same side: <i>that</i>, having been in
  its <i>Perigee</i> at the time of its Opposition, <i>this</i>, having
  been there, out of the time of its Conjunction: where he taketh also
  notice, that this <i>Comet</i> differs in brightness from the other, as
  well in its Body, which is far more vivid and distinct, as in its
  <i>Train</i>, whose splendor is much greater, since it may be seen even
  with great <i>Telescopes</i>, which were useless in the former, by reason
  of its dimness. After this he descends to particulars, and informs us,
  that he began to observe this Comet <i>April</i> the second, and
  continued for some days following, and that as soon as he had made three
  or four Observations, he resolved to try again an <i>Ephemerides</i>; but
  that, having no instruments exact enough, and the Comet being in a place,
  destitute of Stars, and subject to Refractions, he feared to venture too
  much upon Observations so neer one another, since in such matters a
  perfect exactness is necessary, and wished to see some precedent
  Observations to direct him: which having obtained, he thereby verified
  what he had begun, and resolved to carry on his intended
  <i>Ephemerides</i>, especially being urged by his Friends, and engaged by
  his former undertaking, that so it might not be thought a meer hazard,
  that made him hit in the former; as also, that he might try, whether his
  Method would succeed as well in slower, as in swifter Comets, and in
  those, that are neer the Sun; as in such as are opposite thereunto, to
  the end, that men might be advertised of the <i>determination</i> of its
  use, if it could not serve but in certain particular Cases.</p>

  <p>He relateth therefore, that he had finished this New
  <i>Ephemerides</i> <i>April</i> the sixth, and put it presently to the
  Press; in doing of which, he hopes, he hath not disobliged the Publick:
  seeing that, though we should loose the sight of this Star within a few
  days, by reason of its approach to the Sun, yet having found, <!-- Page
  38 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page38"></a>{38}</span>that it is
  always to rise before the Sun, and that we may again see it better, when
  it shall rise betimes, towards the end of <i>May</i>, and in the
  beginning of <i>June</i>, if the cleerness of the Day-break hinder us
  not; he thought it worth the while to try, whether the truth of this
  <i>Ephemerides</i> could be proved.</p>

  <p>He affirms then, that the <i>Line</i> described by this Star resembles
  hitherto a <i>Great Circle</i>, as it is found in all other Comets in the
  midst of their Course. He finds the said Circle inclined to the
  <i>Ecliptick</i> about 26. <i>d.</i> 30&prime;. and the <i>Nodes</i>,
  where it cuts it, towards the beginning of <i>Gemini</i> and
  <i>Sagittary</i>; that it declines from the <i>Equator</i> about 26.
  <i>d</i> and cuts it towards the 11. <i>d.</i> and consequently, that its
  greatest <i>Latitude</i> hath been towards <i>Pisces</i>, where it must
  have been <i>March</i> 24. and its greatest <i>Declination</i>, towards
  the 25 <i>d.</i> of the <i>Equator</i>, where it was to have been
  <i>April</i> 11.</p>

  <p>He puts it in its <i>Perigee</i> <i>March</i> 27. about three of the
  Clock in the Afternoon, when it was about the 15 degrees of
  <i>Pisces</i>, a little more <i>Westerly</i> then <i>Marshab</i>, or the
  <i>Wing</i> of <i>Pegasus</i>, and that it was to be in
  <i>Conjunction</i> with the <i>Sun</i>, <i>April</i> 9. Where yet he
  noteth, that according to another Calculation, the <i>Perigee</i> was
  <i>March</i> 27. more towards Night, so that the Comet advances a little
  more towards the <i>East</i>, and retards towards the <i>West</i>; which
  not being very sensible in the first days, differs more about the end,
  and in the beginning; which he leaves to Observation.</p>

  <p>He calculateth, that the greatest Motion it could make in one day,
  hath been 4. <i>d.</i> and 8&prime;. or 9&prime;; in one hour, about
  10&prime;. and 25&Prime;. so that its <i>Diurnal Motion</i> is to its
  last distance from the Earth a little more than as 1. to 14. and its
  <i>Hourly Motion</i>, as 1. to 330.</p>

  <p>He wonders, that it hath not been seen sooner; the first Observations
  that he hath seen, but made by others, being of <i>March</i> 17. Whereas
  he finds, that it might have been seen since <i>January</i>, at least in
  the Months of <i>February</i> and <i>March</i>, when it rose at 2 of the
  Clock and before: because it is very likely, that, considering its
  bigness and brightness, when it was towards its <i>Perigee</i>, it was
  visible, since that towards the end of <i>February</i> it was not three
  times as much remote from the Earth, than when it was in its
  <i>Perigee</i>, and that towards the end of <i>January</i> it was not
  five times as much. <!-- Page 39 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page39"></a>{39}</span></p>

  <p>In the interim, <i>saith he</i>, the other <i>Comet</i> could be seen
  with the naked eye until <i>January</i> 31. when it was more than ten
  times further remote, than in its <i>Perigee</i>, although it was not by
  far so bright, nor its streamer shining as this hath appeared.</p>

  <p>He wishes, that all the changes that shall fall out in this
  <i>Comet</i>, might be exactly observ'd; because of its not being swift,
  and the Motion of the Earth very sensible, unless the <i>Comet</i> be
  extreamly remote, we should find much more light from this, than the
  former Star, about the Grand Question, whether the <i>Earth</i> moves or
  not; this Author having all along entertained himself with the hopes,
  that the Motion of <i>Comets</i> would evince, whether the <i>Earth</i>
  did move or not; and this very <i>Comet</i> seemed to him to have by
  design appeared for that end, if it had had more <i>Latitude</i>, and
  that consequently we might have seen it before Day break. He wishes also,
  that, if possible, it may be accurately observed, whether it will not a
  little decline from its great Circle towards the <i>South</i>; Judging,
  that some important truth may be thence deduced, as well as if its motion
  retarded more, than the place of its <i>Perigee</i> (which will be more
  exactly known when all the passed Observations shall have been obtained)
  and its greatest Motion do require.</p>

  <p>He fears only, that it being then to rise at Break of Day, exact
  Observations cannot be made of it: but he would, at least have it sought
  with <i>Telescopes</i>, his <i>Ephemerides</i> directing whereabout it is
  to be.</p>

  <p><i>April</i> 10. it was to be over against the point of the
  <i>Triangle</i>, and from thence more <i>Southerly</i> by more than two
  degrees; and <i>April</i> 11. over against the bright Star of
  <i>Aries</i>, <i>April</i> 17. over against the Stars of the <i>Fly</i>,
  a little more <i>Southerly</i>, and <i>May</i> 4 it is to be over against
  the <i>Pleiades</i>, and about the fourth or fifth of the same Month, it
  is to be once more in <i>Conjunction</i> with the <i>Sun</i>; after which
  time, the <i>Sun</i> will move from it <i>Eastward</i>, and leave it
  towards the <i>West</i>; which will enable us to see it again at a better
  hour, provided the cleerness of the Day-break be no impediment to us. He
  addeth, that this Star must have been the third time in
  <i>Conjunction</i> with the <i>Sun</i>, about the time when it first
  began to appear: and foresees, that from all these particulars many
  considerable consequences may be deduced. <!-- Page 40 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page40"></a>{40}</span></p>

  <p>It will cut the <i>Ecliptick</i> about the end of <i>July</i>, new
  Style, a little more <i>Eastwards</i> than the <i>Eye</i> of
  <i>Taurus</i>; at which time there will be no seeing of it, except it be
  with a <i>Telescope</i>.</p>

  <p>It will be towards the <i>End</i> of <i>April</i>, new style, twice as
  far distant as it was in <i>Perigee</i>, thrice as far, <i>May</i> the
  fourth, four times, <i>May</i> the eighteenth, and five times,
  <i>June</i> the first, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

  <p>He would not have Men surprised, that there have been two
  <i>Comets</i> within so short a time; seeing, <i>saith he</i>, there were
  four, at least three, in the Year 1618. and in other Years there have
  been two and more at the same time. What he adds about their
  signification, we leave to <i>Astrologers</i> to dispute it with him. He
  concludeth with asking pardon, if he have committed mistakes, which he
  hopeth he shall obtain the sooner, because of the small time he hath had
  for these calculations; and he wishes that he could have made all the
  Observations himself, seeing that it is easie to fail, when one must
  trust to the Observations of others, whereof we know not the exactness:
  where he instanceth, that according to his Observations, the way of the
  <i>Comet</i> should go neerer the Ecliptick than he hath marked it, even
  without having any great regard to the Refractions: but since he would
  subject himself to others, he hath made it pass a little higher, which,
  he saith, was almost insensibly so, in those few days that he was
  observing and writing, but that this may perhaps become sensible
  hereafter; which if it be so, he affirms that it will cut the
  <i>Ecliptick</i> and <i>Equator</i> sooner, than he hath marked it,
  <i>&amp;c.</i> However, he thinks it convenient, to have given aforehand
  a common Notion of what will become of a <i>Comet</i>, to prepare men for
  all the Changes that may fall out concerning it: which he affirms he hath
  endeavoured to do; the rest being easie to correct, as soon as any good
  Observations, somewhat distant, have been obtained, considering, that
  there need but two very exact ones, a little distant when the Star is not
  swift, to trace its Way; although there must be at least three, to find
  out all the rest. But, then would he have it considered, that although
  his Method should be very exact, if there be not at hand Instruments big
  enough, and Globes good enough to trust to, nothing can be done perfectly
  in these kind of Predictions. <!-- Page 41 --><span class="pagenum"><a

<h3><i>A Relation of the advice given by Monsieur
</i>Petit<i>, Intendant of the Fortifications of
</i>Normandy<i>, touching the Conjunction of the
</i>Ocean<i> and </i>Mediterranean<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>This Intelligent Gentleman, Monsieur <i>Petit</i>, having been
  consulted with, touching the Conjunction of the <i>Ocean</i> and
  <i>Mediterranean</i>, delivers first the Proposition, and then giveth his
  thoughts upon it.</p>

  <p>The Proposition is, That there being about two Leagues below
  <i>Castres</i> in <i>Languedoc</i> a Rivolet, called <i>Sor</i>, passing
  to <i>Revel</i>, there may by the means thereof be made a Communication
  of the two Seas, by joyning the Waters of this Rivolet by a Channel (to
  be kept full all the year long) with those of St. <i>Papoul</i>, and
  others, which fall into <i>Fresqueil</i> (another small River) that runs
  into the <i>Aude</i> below <i>Carcassone</i>, and go together to
  <i>Narbonne</i>, scituated upon the <i>Mediterranean</i>.</p>

  <p>Having given the Proposition, he adds some particulars, to illustrate
  the same, before he declares his judgment upon it. For he relateth, that
  there is but one way, after the division of the Waters, to pass to the
  <i>Mediterranean</i>, which is by a Rivolet, called <i>Fresqueil</i>,
  that is conjoyn'd with the <i>Aude</i>: But, to pass to the <i>Ocean</i>,
  there are three; One, by <i>Riege</i>, entring into the <i>Caronne</i>
  above <i>Tholouse</i>; the other, by <i>Lers</i>, passing on the side,
  and below the same Town; and the third, by <i>Sor</i>, falling into the
  River <i>Agoust</i> under <i>Castres</i>, afterwards into the
  <i>Tarne</i>, and thence to <i>Montauban</i>, and lastly into the
  <i>Garonne</i>. And that, to compass this design, all these Rivers and
  Rivolets are first to be made Navigable unto their <i>Sluces</i>; that of
  <i>Aude</i> and <i>Fresqueil</i> for the <i>Mediterranean</i>, and one of
  the others, such as shall be chosen, for the <i>Ocean</i>. He addeth,
  that, as to the several Ways passing to the <i>Ocean</i>, all of them
  commended as proper and convenient, and the three Countries concerned
  therein, speaking every one for their advantage: Those of <i>Castres</i>
  and <!-- Page 42 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page42"></a>{42}</span><i>Montauban</i>, are for the River
  <i>Agoust</i>; those of <i>Tholouse</i>, for <i>Riege</i>; and the rest,
  for <i>Lers</i>.</p>

  <p>Now concerning his Opinion upon this Proposition, he thinks, that all
  that hath been represented touching this matter, can signifie very
  little, seeing that the main thing is wanting, which is the assurance,
  and certain and positive mensuration of the height and quantity of the
  Waters, necessary to fall into both the Channels of the <i>Aude</i> and
  <i>Caronne</i>: that there must be plenty of that, to furnish at all
  times and alwayes the highest and first <i>sluces</i>, since what once
  issues thence, doth never enter again into them; and after some Boats are
  passed, if there should not be a sufficient supply for those that come
  after; either to go up, or to go down, all would stand dry, and Merchants
  and their commodities would stay long enough expecting the supply of
  Rains, to their great detriment. He concludeth therefore, that no knowing
  and discreet Person is able, in matters of this nature, to give a
  positive answer, without having before him a large and exact
  Topographical Map of those places, and of the sources of all the
  Rivolets, that are to supply the Water to the Head of the pretended
  Channel, together with a full account of the survey and mensuration of
  all the places, through which it is to pass; of the Nature of the Ground,
  whether it be stony, sandy, rocky, <i>&amp;c.</i> of the exact level of
  all the places, where it is to be made, and of the several risings and
  depressions thereof, to be assured that the Water may be conveyed to the
  greatest rising, and to the highest <i>Sluce</i>; and lastly, of the
  quantity, that may be had at high, middle, and low Water, to have enough
  for all times; that all these things being first made out, 'tis then time
  enough to judge of the possibility of the thing, and to calculate the
  charges necessary for Execution.</p>

  <p>This Artist having thus prudently waved this Proposition, diverts
  himself with reflecting upon several others of the like nature, among
  which he insists chiefly upon two, whereof one is that so much celebrated
  in <i>Egypt</i>; the other, of <i>Germany</i>. And he is of Opinion, that
  the most important of all is that, of conjoyning the <i>Red sea</i> by
  the <i>Nile</i> with the <i>Mediterranean</i>, which he looks upon as the
  most excellent conveniency to go into the <i>East Indies</i> without
  doubling the <i>Cape of Good Hope</i>; and yet it <!-- Page 43 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page43"></a>{43}</span>could not be executed by
  those great Kings of <i>Egypt</i>, that raised so many stupendious
  <i>Pyramids</i>; although in his Opinion the reasons alleged by
  <i>Historians</i> to justifie them for having abandoned that undertaking
  are of no validity, and that the <i>Red Sea</i> cannot be, as they
  feared, higher than the <i>Nile</i>, and therefore not indanger the
  inundation of <i>Egypt</i>.</p>

  <p>The other Proposition was made to <i>Charles Magna</i>, <i>Anno</i>
  793. for joyning the <i>Euxine</i> Sea and the <i>Ocean</i> together, by
  a Channel, which was begun for that end, and designed to be 2000. paces
  long and 100. paces broad, betwixt the River <i>Altmull</i>, falling into
  the <i>Danube</i> above <i>Ratisbone</i>, and the River <i>Rott</i>,
  passing at <i>Nurenberg</i>, and thence running into the <i>Main</i>, and
  so into the <i>Rhine</i>. But yet this also proved abortive, though there
  was great appearance of success at first.</p>

<h3><i>Of the Way of killing </i>Ratle-Snakes<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>There being not long since occasion given at a meeting of the <i>Royal
  Society</i> to discourse of <i>Ratle Snakes</i>, that worthy and
  inquisitive Gentleman, Captain <i>Silas Taylor</i>, related the manner,
  how they were killed in <i>Virginia</i>, which he afterwards was pleased
  to give in writing, attested by two credible persons in whose presence it
  was done; which is, as follows.</p>

  <p>The Wild <i>Penny-royal</i> or <i>Ditany</i> of <i>Virginia</i>,
  groweth streight up about one foot high, with the leaves like
  <i>Penny-royal</i>, with little blue tufts at the joyning of the branches
  to the Plant, the colour of the Leaves being a reddish green, but the
  Water distilled, of the colour of Brandy, of a fair Yellow: the Leaves of
  it bruised are very hot biting upon the Tongue: and of these, so bruised,
  they took some, and having tyed them in the cleft of a long stick, they
  held them to the Nose of the <i>Ratle-Snake</i>, who by turning and
  wriggling laboured as much as she could to avoid it: but she was killed
  with it, in less than half an hours time, and, as was supposed, by the
  scent thereof; which was done <i>Anno</i> 1657. in the Month of
  <i>July</i>, at which season, they repute those creatures to be in the
  greatest vigour for their poison. <!-- Page 44 --><span

<h3><i>A Relation of Persons killed with subterraneous </i>Damps<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>This Relation was likewise made to the <i>Royal Society</i>, by that
  Eminent <i>Virtuoso</i> Sir <i>R. Moray</i>, who was pleased, upon their
  desire, to give it them in writing; as followeth.</p>

  <p>In a Coal-pit, belonging to the Lord <i>Sinclair</i> in
  <i>Scotland</i>, where the Coal is some 18 or 20 foot thick, and
  antiently wasted to a great depth: The Colliers, some Weeks agoe, having
  wrought as deep as they could, and being to remove into new Rooms (as
  they call them) did, by taking off, as they retired, part of the Coal
  that was left as Pillars to support the Roof and Earth over it, so much
  weaken them, that within a short space, after they were gone out of the
  Pitt, the Pillars falling, the Earth above them filled up the whole
  Space, where the Colliers had lately wrought, with its ruins. The
  Colliers being here-by out of work, some of them adventured to work upon
  old remains of Walls, so near the old wastes, that striking through the
  slender partition of the Coal-wall, that seperated between them and the
  place, where they used to work, they quickly perceived their Errour, and
  fearing to be stifled by the bad Air, that they knew, possessed these old
  wastes, in regard not onely of the Damps, which such wastes do usually
  afford, but because there having for many years been a Fire in those
  wastes, that filled them with stifling fumes and vapors, retired
  immediately and saved themselves from the eruptions of the Damp. But next
  day some seven or eight of them came no sooner so farr down the staires,
  that led them to the place where they had been the day before, as they
  intended, but upon their stepping into the place, where the Air was
  infected, they fell down dead, as if they had been shott: And there being
  amongst them one, whose Wife was informed he was stifled in that place,
  she went down so far without inconvenience, that seeing her Husband near
  her, ventured to go to him, but being choaked by the Damp, as soon as she
  came near him, she fell down dead by him. <!-- Page 45 --><span

  <p>This Story of Sir <i>R. Moray</i> affirmed to have received from the
  <i>Earl</i> of <i>Weymes</i>, Brother in Law to the Lord <i>Sinclair</i>,
  as it was written to him from <i>Scotland</i>.</p>

<h3><i>Of the </i>Mineral<i> of </i>Liege<i>, yeilding both </i>Brimstone<i>
and </i>Vitriol<i>, and the way of extracting
them out of it, used at </i>Liege<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>The Account of this <i>Mineral</i>, and of the way of extracting both
  <i>Brimstone</i> and <i>Vitriol</i> out of it, was procured from
  <i>Liege</i>, by the lately mentioned Sir <i>Robert Moray</i> and by him
  communicated to the <i>Royal Society</i>, as follows.</p>

  <p>The <i>Mineral</i>, out of which <i>Brimstone</i> and <i>Vitriol</i>
  are extracted, is one and the same, not much unlike Lead ore, having also
  oft times much Lead mingled with it, which is seperated from it by
  picking it out of the rest. The Mines resemble our <i>English</i> Coal
  Mines dugg according to the depth of the <i>Mineral</i>, 15, 20, or more
  fathoms, as the Vein leads the Workmen, or the subterranean waters will
  give them leave, which in Summer so overflow the Mines, that the upper
  waters, by reason of the drought, not sufficing to make the Pumps goe,
  the Work ceases.</p>

  <p>To make <i>Brimstone</i>, they break the Stone or Ore into small
  pieces, which they put into Crucibles made of Earth, five foot long,
  square and Pyramid-wise. The Entry is near a foot square. These Crucibles
  are laid sloaping, eight undermost, and seven above them, as it were
  betwixt them, that the Fire may come at them all, each having its
  particular Furnace or Oven. The <i>Brimstone</i> being dissolved by the
  violence of the heat, drops out at the small end of the Crucible, and
  falls into a Leaden-Trough or Receptacle, common to all the said
  Crucibles, through which there runs a continual Rivolet of cold water,
  conveyed thither by Pipes for the cooling of the dissolved Sulphur, which
  is ordinarily four hours in melting. This done, the Ashes are drawn out
  by a crooked Iron, and being put into an Iron Wheel barrow, are carried
  out of the Hutt, and <!-- Page 46 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page46"></a>{46}</span>being laid in a heap, are covered with other
  exiled or drained Ashes, the better to keep them warm; which is
  reiterated, as long as they make <i>Brimstone</i>.</p>

  <p>To make <i>Coperas</i> or <i>Vitriol</i>, they take a quantity of the
  said Ashes, and throwing them into a square planked pit in the Earth,
  some four foot deep, and eight foot square, they cover the same with
  ordinary water, and let it lye twenty four hours, or until an Egg will
  swim upon the liquor, which is a sign, that it is strong enough. When
  they will boyl this, they let it run through Pipes into the Kettles,
  adding to it half as much Mother-water, which is that water, that remains
  after boyling of the hardned <i>Coperas</i>. The Kettles are made of
  Lead, 4½ foot high, 6 foot long, and 3 foot broad, standing upon thick
  Iron Barrs or Grates. In these the Liquor is boyled with a strong
  Coal-fire, twenty four hours or more, according to the strength or
  weakness of the Lee or Water. When it is come to a just consistence, the
  fire is taken away, and the boyled liquor suffered to cool somewhat, and
  then it is tapp'd out of the said Kettles, through holes beneath in the
  sides of them, and conveyed through wooden Conduits into several
  Receptacles, three foot deep and four foot long (made and ranged not
  unlike our Tan-pits) where it remains fourteen or fifteen dayes, or so
  long till the <i>Coperas</i> separate it self from the water, and becomes
  icy and hard. The remaining water is the above-mentioned Mother-water;
  and the elixed or drained Ashes are the Dregs, or <i>Caput mortuum</i>,
  which the Lee, whereof the <i>Vitriol</i> is made, leaves behind it in
  the planked Pits.</p>

<h3><i>A further Account of Mr. </i>Boyle<i>'s Experimental
</i>History<i> of </i>Cold<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>In the first Papers of these <i>Philosophical Transactions</i>, some
  promise was made of a <i>fuller</i> account, to be given by the next, of
  the <i>Experimental History of Cold</i>, composed by the Honourable Mr.
  <i>Robert Boyle</i>; it being then supposed, that this <i>History</i>
  would have been altogether printed off at the time of publishing the <!--
  Page 47 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page47"></a>{47}</span><i>Second</i> Papers of these
  <i>Transactions</i>; but the Press, employed upon this Treatise, having
  been retarded somewhat longer than was ghessed, the said promise could
  not be performed before this time: wherein it now concerns the inquiring
  World to take notice, that this subject, as it hath hitherto bin almost
  totally neglected, so it is now, by this Excellent Author, in such a
  manner handled, and improved by near <i>Two hundred</i> choice
  <i>Experiments</i> and <i>Observations</i>, that certainly the
  <i>Curious</i> and <i>Intelligent</i> Reader will in the perusal thereof
  find cause to admire both the Fertility of a Subject, seemingly so
  barren, and the Author's Abilities of improving the same to so high a
  Degree.</p>

  <p>But to take a short view of some of the particulars of this
  <i>History</i>, and thereby to give occasion to <i>Philosophical</i> men,
  to take this Subject more into their consideration, than hitherto hath
  been done; the Ingenious Readers will here see,</p>

  <p>1, That not only all sorts of <i>Acid</i> and <i>Alcalizate</i> Salts,
  and Spirits, even Spirit of Wine, but also Sugar, and Sugar of Lead mixed
  with Snow, are capable of freezing other Bodies, and upon what account
  they are so.</p>

  <p>2, That among the Substances capable of being frozen, there are not
  only all gross sorts of Saline Bodies, but such also as are freed from
  their grosser parts, not excepting Spirit of Urine, the <i>Lixivium</i>
  of Pot-ashes, nor Oyl of Tartar, <i>per deliquium</i>, it self.</p>

  <p>3, That many very spiritous liquors, freed from their aqueous parts,
  cannot be brought to freeze, neither naturally, nor artificially: And
  here is occasionally mentioned a way of keeping <i>Moats</i> unpassable
  in very cold Countries, recorded by <i>Olaus Magnus</i>.</p>

  <p>4, What are the ways proper to estimate the greater or lesser Coldness
  of Bodies; and by what means we can measure the intensness of Cold
  produced by Art, beyond that, which Nature needs to employ for the
  freezing of Water; as also, in what proportion water of a moderate degree
  of Coldness will <!-- Page 48 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page48"></a>{48}</span>be made to <i>shrink</i> by Snow and Salt,
  before it begin by Congelation to <i>expand</i> it self; and then, how to
  measure by the differing Weight and Density of the same portion of Water,
  what change was produced in it, betwixt the hottest time of Summer, and
  first glaciating degree of Cold, and then the highest, which our Author
  could produce by <i>Art</i>: Where an Inquiry is annex'd, whether the
  making of these kind of Tryals with the waters of the particular Rivers
  and Seas, men are to sail on, may afford any useful estimate, whether or
  not, and how much, ships may on those waters be safely loaden more in
  Winter, than in Summer. To which is added the way of making exact
  Discoveries of the differing degrees of Coldness in differing Regions, by
  such Thermometers, as are not subject to the alterations of the
  <i>Atmosphere's</i> gravitation, nor to be frozen.</p>

  <p>5. Whether, in Cold, the diffusion from Cold Bodies be made more
  strongly downwards, contrary to that of Hot Bodies: Where is delivered a
  way of freezing Liquors without danger of breaking the Vessel, by making
  them begin to freeze at the bottom, not the top.</p>

  <p>6. Whether that Tradition be true, that if frozen Apples or Eggs be
  thaw'd neer the Fire, they will be thereby spoil'd, but if immersed in
  cold water, the Internal Cold will be drawn out, as is supposed, by the
  External Cold; and the frozen Bodies will be harmlesly thawed?
  <i>Item</i>, Whether Iron, or other Metals, Glass, Stone, Cheese,
  <i>&amp;c.</i> expos'd to the freezing Air, or kept in Snow, or Salt,
  upon the immersing them in Water will produce any Ice? <i>Item</i>, What
  use may be made of what happens in the different waies of thawing Eggs
  and Apples, by applying the Observation to other Bodies, and even to Men,
  dangerously nipp'd by excessive Cold. Where is added not only a memorable
  Relation, how the whole Body of a Man was succesfully thawed and cased
  all over with Ice, by being handled, as frozen Eggs and Apples are; but
  also the Luciferousness of such Experiments, as these: and likewise, what
  the effects of Cold may be, as to the Conservation or Destruction of the
  Textures of Bodies: and in particular, how Meat and Drink <!-- Page 49
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page49"></a>{49}</span>may be kept
  good, in very Cold Countries, by keeping it under Water, without
  glaciation? as also, how in extreme Cold Countries, the Bodies of Dead
  Men and other Animals may be preserved very many years entire and
  unputrified? And yet, how such Bodies, when unfrozen, will appear quite
  vitiated by the excessive Cold? Where it is further inquired into,
  whether some Plants, and other Medicinal things, that have specifique
  Vertues, will loose them by being throughly congealed and (several wayes)
  thawed? And also, whether frozen and thawed Harts-horn will yield the
  same quantity and strength of Salt and saline Spirit, as when unfrozen?
  <i>Item</i>, Whether the <i>Electrical</i> faculty of <i>Amber</i>, and
  the <i>Attractive</i> or <i>Directive</i> Virtue of <i>Loadstones</i>
  will be either impaired, or any wayes altered by intense Cold? This Head
  is concluded by some considerable remarks touching the operation of Cold
  upon Bones, Steel, Brass, Wood, Bricks.</p>

  <p>7, What Bodies are expanded by being frozen, and how that expansion is
  evinced? And whether it is caused by the intrusion of Air? As also,
  whether, what is contained in icy bubbles, is true and Springy Air, or
  not.</p>

  <p>8, What Bodies they are, that are contracted by Cold; and how that
  Contraction is evinced? Where 'tis inquired, whether <i>Chymical
  Oyles</i> will, by Congelation, be like expressed Oyls, contracted, or,
  like aqueous Liquors, expanded?</p>

  <p>9, What are the wayes of <i>Measuring</i> the <i>Quantity</i> of the
  Expansion and Contraction of Liquors by Cold? And how the Author's
  account of this matter agrees with what Navigators into cold Climats,
  mention from experience, touching pieces of Ice as high as the Masts of
  their Ships, and yet the Depth of these pieces seems not at all
  answerable to what it may be supposed to be.</p>

  <p>10, How strong the Expansion of freezing water is? Where are
  enumerated the several sorts of Vessels, which being filled <!-- Page 50
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page50"></a>{50}</span>with water, and
  exposed to the cold Air, do burst; and where also the weight is
  expressed, that will be removed by the expansive force of Freezing?
  Whereunto an Inquiry is subjoyned, whence this prodigious force, observed
  in water, expanded by Glaciation, should proceed? And whether this
  <i>Phænomenon</i> may be solved, either by the <i>Cartesian</i>, or
  <i>Epicurean</i> Hypothesis?</p>

  <p>11, What is the <i>Sphere of Activity</i> of Cold, or the Space, to
  whose extremities every way the Action of a cold Body is able to reach:
  where the difficulty of determining these limits, together with the
  causes thereof, being with much circumspection mentioned, it is observed,
  that the <i>Sphere of Activity</i> of Cold is exceeding narrow, not only
  in comparison of that of Heat in Fire, but in comparison of, as it were,
  the <i>Atmosphere</i> of many odorous Bodies; and even in comparison of
  the <i>Sphere of Activity</i> of the more vigorous Loadstones, insomuch,
  that the Author hath doubted, whether the Sense could discern a Cold
  Body, otherwise then by immediate Contract. Where several Experiments are
  delivered for the examining of this matter, together with a curious
  relation of the way used in <i>Persia</i>, though a very hot Climate, to
  furnish their <i>Conservatories</i> with solid pieces of Ice of a
  considerable thickness: To which is added an Observation, how far in
  Earth and Water the Frost will pierce downwards, and upon what accounts
  the deepness of the Frost may vary. After which, the care is inculcated,
  that must be had, in examining, whether Cold may be diffused through all
  <i>Mediums</i> indefinitely, not to make the Trials with <i>Mediums</i>
  of two great thickness: where it is made to appear, that Cold is able to
  operate through Metalline Vessels, which is confirmed by a very pretty
  Experiment of making <i>Icy Cups</i> to drink in, whereof the way is
  accurately set down. Then are related the Trials, whether, or how, Cold
  will be diffused through a <i>Medium</i>, that <i>some</i> would think a
  <i>Vacuum</i>, and which to <i>others</i> would seem much less disposed
  to assist the diffusion of Cold, than Common Air it self. After which
  follows a curious Experiment, shewing whether a Cold Body can operate
  through <!-- Page 51 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page51"></a>{51}</span>a <i>Medium</i> actually hot, and having its
  heat continually renewed by a fountain of heat.</p>

  <p>12, How to estimate the solidity of the Body of Ice, or how strong is
  the mutual adhesion of its parts? and whether differing Degrees of Cold
  may not vary the Degree of the compactness of Ice. And our Author having
  proceeded as far as he was able towards the bringing the strength of Ice
  to some Estimate by several experiments, he communicateth the
  information, he could get about this matter among the Descriptions that
  are given us of cold Regions: and then he relateth out of Sea-mens
  <i>Journals</i>, their Observations touching the insipidness of resolved
  Ice made of Sea-water; and the prodigious bigness of it, extending even
  to the height of two hundred and forty Foot above water, and the length
  of above eight Leagues. To which he adds some promiscuous, but very
  notable Observations concerning Ice, not so readily reducible to the
  foregoing Heads: <i>videlicet</i>, Of the blew colour of Rocky pieces of
  Ice; and the horrid noise made by the breaking of Ice, like that of
  Thunder and Earthquakes, together with a Consideration of the cause,
  whence those loud Ruptures may proceed.</p>

  <p>13, How Ice and Snow may be made to last long; and what Liquor
  dissolves Ice sooner than others, and in what proportion of quickness the
  Solutions in the several Liquors are made, where occasion is offered to
  the Author, to examine, whether Motion will impart a heat to Ice? After
  which he relates an Experiment of <i>Heating</i> a <i>Cold</i> Liquor
  with Ice, made by himself in the presence of a great and Learned
  Nobleman, and his Lady, who found the Glass wherein the Liquor was, so
  hot that they could not endure to hold it in their Hands. Next it is
  examined, whether the effects of Cold do continually depend upon the
  actual presence and influence of the manifest Efficient causes, as the
  Light of the Air depends upon the Sun or Fire, or other Luminous Bodies.
  To this is annexed an Account of the <i>Italian</i> way of making
  <i>Conservatories</i> of Ice and Snow, as the Author had received it from
  that Ingenious and Polite Gentleman, Master <i>J. Evelyn</i>. <!-- Page
  52 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page52"></a>{52}</span></p>

  <p>But want of time prohibiting the accomplishment of the intended
  account of this Rich Piece: what remains, must be referred to the next
  Occasion. It shall only be intimated for a Conclusion, that the
  <i>Author</i> hath annexed to this <i>Treatise</i>, an Examen of Master
  <i>Hob</i>'s Doctrine touching <i>Cold</i>; wherein the <i>Grand</i>
  Cause of <i>Cold</i> and its Effects is assigned to <i>Wind</i>, in so
  much that 'tis affirmed, that almost any Ventilation and stirring of the
  Air doth refrigerate.</p>

<h3><i>A Relation of some extraordinary Tydes in the
West-Isles of </i>Scotland<i>, as it was communicated
by Sr. </i>Robert Moray<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>In that Tract of <i>Isles</i>, on the West of <i>Scotland</i>, called
  by the Inhabitants, the <i>Long-Island</i>, as being about 100. miles
  long from <i>North</i> to <i>South</i>, there is a multitude of small
  Islands, situated in a <i>Fretum</i>, or <i>Frith</i>, that passes
  between the Island of <i>Eust</i>, and the <i>Herris</i>; amongst which,
  there is one called <i>Berneray</i>, some three miles long, and <!-- Page
  54 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page54"></a>{54}</span>more than a
  mile broad, the length running from <i>East</i> to <i>West</i>, as the
  <i>Frith</i> lyes. At the <i>East</i> end of this <i>Island</i>, where I
  stayed some 16. or 17. dayes, I <i>observed</i> a very strange
  Reciprocation of the Flux and Re-flux of the Sea, and <i>heard</i> of
  another, no less remarkable.</p>

  <p>Upon the <i>West</i> side of the <i>Long Island</i>, the Tides, which
  came from the <i>South-west</i>, run along the Coast, <i>Northward</i>;
  so that during the ordinary course of the Tides, the Flood runs
  <i>East</i> in the <i>Frith</i>, where <i>Berneray</i> lyes, and the Ebb
  <i>West</i>. And thus the Sea ebbs and flows orderly, some 4. days before
  the <i>full Moon</i>, and <i>change</i>, and as long after (the ordinary
  Spring-tides rising some 14. or 15. foot upright, and all the rest
  proportionably, as in other places). But afterwards, some 4. days before
  the <i>Quarter-moons</i>, and as long after, there is constantly a great
  and singular <i>variation</i>. For <i>then</i>, (a <i>Southerly</i> Moon
  making there the full Sea) the course of the Tide being <i>Eastward</i>,
  when it begins to flow, which is about 9½ of the Clock, not onely
  continues so till about 3½ in the afternoon, that it be high water, but,
  after it begins to ebb, the Current runs on still <i>Eastward</i>, during
  the whole Ebb; so that it runs <i>Eastward</i> 12 hours together, that
  is, all day long, from about 9½ in the morning, til about 9½ at night.
  But then, when the night-Tide begins to flow, the Current turns, and runs
  <i>Westward</i> all night, during both Floud &amp; Ebb, for some 12.
  hours more, as it did <i>Eastward</i> the day before. And thus the
  Reciprocations continue, one Floud and Ebb, running 12 hours
  <i>Eastward</i>, and another twelve hours <i>Westward</i>, till 4. days
  before the <i>New</i> and <i>Full</i> Moon; and then they resume their
  ordinary regular course as before, running <i>East</i>, during the six
  hours of Floud, and <i>West</i>, during the six of Ebb. And this I
  observed curiously, during my abode upon the place, which was in the
  Moneth of <i>August</i>, as I remember.</p>

  <p>But the Gentleman, to whom the <i>Island</i> belongs at present, and
  divers of his Brothers and Friends, knowing and discreet persons, and
  expert in all such parts of Sea-matters, as other <i>Islanders</i>
  commonly are, though I shrewdly suspected their skill in Tides, when I
  had not yet seen what they told me, and I have now related of these
  irregular Courses of the Tides, did most confidently assure me, and so
  did every body I spake with <!-- Page 55 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page55"></a>{55}</span>about it, that there is yet another
  irregularity in the Tides, which never fails, and is no less
  extraordinary, than what I have been mentioning: which is, That, whereas
  between the <i>Vernal</i> and <i>Autumnal Equinoxes</i>, that is, for six
  Moneths together, the Course of irregular Tides about the Quartermoons,
  is, to run all day, that is, twelve hours, as from about 9½ to 9½, 10¼ to
  10¼ <i>&amp;c. Eastward</i>, and all night, that is, twelve hours more,
  <i>Westward</i>: during the other six Moneths, from the <i>Autumnal</i>
  to the <i>Vernal Equinox</i>, the Current runs all day <i>Westward</i>,
  and all Night <i>Eastward</i>.</p>

  <p>Of this, though I had not the opportunity to be an Eye-witness, as of
  the other, yet I do not at all doubt, having received so credible
  Information of it.</p>

  <p>To penetrate into the <i>Causes</i> of these strange Reciprocations of
  the Tides, would require exact descriptions of the Situation, Shape, and
  Extent of every piece of the adjacent Coasts of <i>Eust</i> and
  <i>Herris</i>; the Rocks, Sands, Shelves, Promontorys, Bays, Lakes,
  Depths, and other Circumstances which I cannot now set down with any
  certainty, or accurateness; seeing, they are to be found in no
  <i>Map</i>, neither had I any opportunity to survey them; nor do they now
  occur to my Memory, as they did some years ago, when upon occasion I
  ventured to make a <i>Map</i> of this whole <i>Frith</i> of
  <i>Berneray</i>, which not having copied, I cannot adventure to beat it
  out again.</p>

<h3><i></i>Monsieur Auzout<i>'s Judgment touching the Apertures
of </i>Object-Glasses<i>, and their </i>Proportions<i>,
in respect of the several </i>Lengths<i> of
</i>Telescopes<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>This Author, observing in a small <i>French Tract</i> lately written
  by him to a Countryman of his, Monsieur <i>L' Abbe Charles</i>; That
  great <i>Optick Glasses</i> have almost never as great an <i>Aperture</i>
  as the small ones, in proportion to what they Magnifie, and that
  therefore they must be more dim; takes occasion to inform <!-- Page 56
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page56"></a>{56}</span>the
  <i>Reader</i>, that he hath found, that the <i>Apertures</i>, which
  <i>Optick-Glasses</i> can bear with distinctness, are in about a
  <i>subduplicate proportion</i> to their <i>Lengths</i>; whereof he tells
  us he intends to give the reason and demonstration in his
  <i>Diopticks</i>, which he is now writing, and intends to finish, as soon
  as his Health will permit. In the mean time, he presents the
  <i>Reader</i> with a <i>Table</i> of such <i>Apertures</i>; which is here
  exhibited to the Consideration of the Ingenious, there being of this
  <i>French</i> Book but one Copy, that is known, in <i>England</i>.</p>

<h3><i>Considerations of Monsieur </i>Auzout<i> upon Mr.
</i>Hook<i>'s New Instrument for Grinding of
</i>Optick-Glasses<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>In the above-mentioned <i>French</i> Tract, there are, besides several
  other particulars, to be represented in due place, contained some
  <i>Considerations</i> of Monsieur <i>Auzout</i> upon Mr. <i>Hook</i>'s
  New <i>Engine</i> for grinding <i>Optick-Glasses</i>. Where he premises
  in <i>General</i> his thoughts touching the working of <i>Great</i>
  Optick-Glasses, and that by the help of a <i>Turn lathe</i>; affirming
  first of all, that not only the <i>Engin</i> is to be considered for
  giveing the <i>Figure</i>, but the <i>Matter</i> also, which ought to be
  brought to greater perfection, than it hath been hitherto. For, he finds
  it not so easie (as least, <i>where he is</i>) to procure <i>Great</i>
  pieces of Glass without <i>Veins</i>, and other faults, nor to get such,
  as are thick enough without <i>Blebbs</i>; which, if they be not, they
  will yield to the pressure and weight, either when they are fitted to the
  <i>Cement</i>, or wrought.</p>

  <p>Secondly, He finds it difficult to work these <i>Great</i> Glasses of
  the <i>same</i> thickness, which yet is very necessary, because, that the
  least difference in <i>Figures</i> so little <i>convex</i>, can put the
  <i>Center</i> out of the <i>Midle</i>, 2 or 3 <i>Inches</i>; and if they
  be wrought in <i>Moulds</i>, the length of time, which is required to
  wear and to smooth them, may spoil the best <i>Mould</i>, before they be
  finished. Besides, that the strength of Man is so limited, that he is
  unable to work Glasses beyond a certain bigness, so as to finish and
  polish them all over so well, as <i>small</i> Glasses; whereas yet, the
  bigger they are, the more compleat they ought to be: And if any weight or
  Engine be used to supply strength, there is then danger of an unequal
  pressure, and of wearing away the Engine; In the mean time, the
  preciseness and delicateness is <!-- Page 58 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page58"></a>{58}</span>greater than can easily be imagined.
  Wherefore he could never, having some experience of this preciseness,
  conceive, that a <i>Turn-lathe</i>, wherein must be two different, and in
  some manner contrary motions, can move with that exactness and
  steddiness, that is required, especially, for any considerable length of
  time.</p>

  <p>Having premised this, he discourses upon Mr. <i>Hook</i> his
  <i>Turne</i>, intimating first of all, that he was impatient to know what
  kind of <i>Turne</i> this was, imagining, that it had been tried, and had
  succeeded, as coming from a Society that professeth, they publish nothing
  but what hath been maturely examin'd. But that he was much surprised when
  he saw the <i>Micrography</i> of Mr. <i>Hook</i>, and found there, that
  his <i>Engine</i> was published upon a <i>meer Theory</i>, without having
  made any Experiment, though that might have been made with little charge
  and great speed; expence of Money and Time being the onely thing, that
  can excuse those who in matter of <i>Engines</i> impart their inventions
  to the publick, without having tried them, to excite others to make trial
  thereof.</p>

  <p>Whereupon he proposes some difficulties, to give the <i>Inventor</i>
  occasion to find a way to remove them. He affirms therefore, that though
  it be true in the <i>Theory</i>, that a <i>Circle</i>, whose <i>Plain</i>
  is inclined to the <i>Axis</i> of the <i>Sphere</i> by an <i>Angle</i>,
  whereof half the <i>Diameter</i> is the <i>Sine</i>, and which touches
  the <i>Sphere</i> in its <i>Pole</i>, will touch in all its parts a
  <i>spherical Surface</i>, that shall turn upon that <i>Axe</i>. But that
  it is true also, that that must be but a <i>Mathematical Circle</i>, and
  without <i>Breadth</i>, and which precisely touches the Body in its
  middle: Whereas in the practice, a <i>Circle</i> capable to keep Sand and
  Putty, must be of some <i>breadth</i>; and he knows not whether we can
  find such a dexterity of keeping so much of it, and for so long a time,
  as needs, upon the Brim of a <i>Ring</i> that is half an Inch broad. He
  adds, that it is very difficult to contrive, that the middle of the Glass
  do always precisely answer to the Brim of this <i>Ring</i>, seeing that
  the position of the Glass does always change a little in respect of the
  <i>Ring</i>, in proportion as 'tis worn, and as it must be pressed
  because of its inclination. He believes it also very hard, to give to the
  <i>Axis</i> or to the <i>Mandril</i>, which holds the Glass, that little
  <!-- Page 59 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page59"></a>{59}</span><i>Inclination</i>, that would be necessary
  for great Glasses, and to make the two <i>Mandrils</i> to have one and
  the same <i>Plain</i>, as is necessary. And, having done all this, he
  persuades himself, that it is exceedingly difficult, if not impossible,
  for two contrary motions, where so many pieces are, to rest for a long
  time steddy and firm, as is requisite for the not swarving from it a
  hair's thickness, since less than that can change all.</p>

  <p>He goes on, and, seeing that this <i>Inventor</i> speaks of Glasses of
  a thousand, &amp; ten thousand foot, which he supposed not impossible to
  be made by this <i>Engine</i>, discourses of what is necessary for the
  making Glasses of such <span class="correction" title="Original reads `bigness', corrected by errata, page 70."
  >bignesses</span>; which he believes this <i>Inventor</i> may perhaps not
  have thought of. Wherefore he affirms, that if the <i>Table</i>, made by
  himself for the <i>Apertures</i> of Glasses (which is that, that is above
  delivered) be continued unto a thousand feet, by taking always the
  <i>Subduplicate proportion</i> of <i>Lengths</i>, it will be found, that
  for pretty good ones, the <i>Aperture</i> must be of 15. Inches; for good
  ones, more than 18. and for such as are excellent, more than 21. Inches:
  whence it may be judged, what piece of Glass, and of what thickness it
  must be, to <span class="correction" title="Original reads `resist', corrected by errata, page 70."
  >endure</span> the working. But he proceeds to speak of the
  <i>Inclination</i>, which the <i>Mandril</i> must have upon the
  <i>Plain</i> of the <i>Ring</i>, when the <i>Ring</i> should have 10. or
  12 Inches; and finds, that it would make but 6 or 7. minutes of
  inclination, and that a Glass would have less <i>Convexity</i>, and
  consequently, less difference from a Glass perfectly plain, than the 7.
  or 8. part of a Line. And then he leaveth it to be judged, whether a
  Glass of such a Length being found, we ought to hope, that a <i>Turn</i>
  can be firm enough to keep such a piece of Glass in the same Inclination,
  so that a <i>Mandril</i> do not recede some Minutes from it: and, though
  even the Glass could be fastned perfectly perpendicular to the
  <i>Mandril</i>, that <span class="correction" title="Original reads `these', corrected by errata, page 70."
  >those</span> two <i>Mandrils</i> could be put in one and the same <span
  class="correction" title="Original reads `place', corrected by errata, page 70."
  >Plain</span>, &amp; that that little Inclination, which is requisite,
  could be given, and the <i>Mandril</i> be continued to be pressed in that
  same <i>Inclination</i>, according as the Glass is worn. All which
  particulars, he conceives to be very hard in the practice; not to
  mention, that the weight of the Glass, that should be inclined to the
  <i>Horizon</i>, as 'tis represented by Mr. <i>Hook</i>, would make it
  slide upon the <i>Cement</i>, and so <!-- Page 60 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page60"></a>{60}</span>change the <i>Center</i>;
  and that the Glass is not pressed at the same time by the <i>Ring</i> but
  in one part on the side, <i>vid.</i> about a fourth; and that the parts
  of the Glass are not equally worn away, <i>&amp;c.</i> What then,
  <i>saith he</i>, would becom of a Glass of 10000 feet, which, according
  to the said Table, would have more than four feet, or four feet and nine
  inches, or five feet, seven inches <i>Aperture</i>, and of which the
  <i>Ring</i>, though it were two feet nine inches, would have but one
  minut of <i>Inclination</i>, and the Glass of 5 feet <i>Aperture</i>
  would have but 4 minuts, and the curvity of it would be less than the
  <span class="correction" title="Original reads `hundred', corrected by errata, page 118."
  >eight</span> part of a Line.</p>

  <p>But, <i>saith he</i>, let us consider, only a Glass of 300 foot, to
  see, what is to be hoped of that, and to know at least the difficulty, to
  be met with in making a Glass only of that Length. A Glass then of 300
  foot, according to his Table, must have more than 8 inches
  <i>Aperture</i>, which maketh but 16 minuts of its <i>Circle</i>, and it
  should have more than 11 inches, if it be an excellent one. If Mr.
  <i>Hook</i> (adds he) did use but his <i>Ring</i> of 6 inches, which he
  would use from twelve to an hundred foot Glass, the <i>Inclination</i>,
  which the <i>Axis</i>, or <i>Mandril</i>, that bears his Glass, should
  have, should be but 16 minuts, and the <i>Curvity</i> of the Glass would
  be less than the eighth part of a Line, and if he should use a bigger,
  the <i>Inclination</i> would be proportionable.</p>

  <p>Whence it may be judged (continues he) that we are yet very far from
  seeing <i>Animals &amp;c.</i> in the <i>Moon</i>, as Monsieur <i>Des
  Cartes</i> gave hope, and Mr. <i>Hook</i> despairs not of. For, he
  believes by what he knows of <i>Telescopes</i>, that we are not to look
  for any above 300 or 400 foot at most; and he fears, that neither
  <i>Matter</i> nor <i>Art</i> will go even so far.</p>

  <p>When therefore (<i>saith he</i>) a Glass of 300 foot should bear an
  Eye-glass of 6 inches (which would appear wonderful) it would magnifie
  but 600. times in <i>Diameter</i>, that is, 360000 times in
  <i>Surface</i>: but suppose, that such could be made, as would magnifie a
  1000 times in <i>Diameter</i>, and 1000000. of times in <i>Surface</i>,
  admitting there were but 60000 leagues from the <i>Earth</i> to the
  <i>Moon</i>, and that the smalness of the <i>Aperture</i> of the Glasses
  (which yet would diminish the Light more than 36 times) and the obstacle
  of the Air were not considered, we should not <!-- Page 61 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page61"></a>{61}</span>see the <i>Moon</i>, but
  as if we were a 100, or at least, 60. leagues distant from her without a
  Glass. He here wishes, that those, that promise to make us see
  <i>Animals</i> and <i>Plants</i> in the Moon, had thought on what our
  naked Eyes can make us discern of such Objects, only at 10 or 12 leagues
  distance.</p>

  <p>But this he would not have understood as a discouragement from
  searching with all care and earnestness after the means of making long
  <i>Telescopes</i>, or of facilitating the working thereof; but only as an
  Advertisement to those, who light upon the <i>Theory</i> of any
  <i>Engine</i>, not to expose it presently as possible and useful, before
  they have tried it, or if it have succeeded in small, not to endeavour to
  persuade, that it will also succeed in great.</p>

  <p>As it may happen (<i>saith he</i>) that the Engin of Mr. <i>Hook</i>
  may, by using all necessary precautions, succeed in the making of
  <i>Eye-Glasses</i>, or <i>small</i> Optick-Glasses, but not in making
  <i>great</i> ones; as we see, that an instrument composed of two Rulers,
  wherewith are traced Portions of Circles, succeeds well enough in
  <i>small</i>, but when there is no more than half a Line, a quarter of a
  Line, or less convexity, it will be no longer just at all, as he tells us
  to have made the proof of it in Circles drawn by the means of one of
  these Instruments, made by one of the best Workmen in his time, who,
  whilst he lived, esteemed them above price, although they be not just; as
  others and my self (<i>saith he</i>) have by tryal found, when we
  endeavoured to make <i>Moulds</i> by their means, &amp; as those, who by
  the like Instrument laboured to trace portions of Circles of 80 or 100
  foot, <i>&amp;c. Diameter</i>, can attest.</p>

  <p>But, notwithstanding all this, he hath thought upon two or three
  things, which he thinks may remedy some inconveniencies of Mr.
  <i>Hook</i> his <i>Turn</i>. The <i>first</i> is, to invert the Glass,
  and to put it under the <i>Ring</i>, that so not only the Glass may be
  placed more <i>Horizontally</i>, and not slide upon the <i>Cement</i>,
  but that the <i>Sand</i> also, and the <i>Putty</i> may stay upon the
  Glass.</p>

  <p>The <i>other</i> is, that there must be two <i>Poppetheads</i>, into
  which the <i>Mandril</i> must pass, where the <i>Ring</i> is to be
  fastned; and the <i>Mandril</i> must be perfectly <i>Cylindrical</i>,
  that so it may advance upon the Glass as it wears away by the means of
  its weight, or by the means of a spring, pressing it, without wrigling
  from one place to another, as it would presently happen in the fashion,
  <!-- Page 62 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page62"></a>{62}</span>as
  the <i>Turn</i> is composed. For, when the Glasses do wear, especially
  when they are very <i>convex</i>, it cannot be otherwise, but the
  <i>Mandril</i> will play and wrigle, before the <i>Scrue</i> be made
  firm.</p>

  <p>But he doubts, whether all can be remedied, which he leavs to the
  industry of Mr. <i>Hook</i>, considering what he saith in the
  <i>Preface</i> of his <i>Micrography</i>, touching a Method, he knows, of
  finding out as much in <i>Mechanicks</i>, as can be found in
  <i>Geometry</i> by <i>Algebra</i>.</p>

  <p>Besides this, he taketh notice, that most of those that medle with
  <i>Optick-Glasses</i>, give them not as much <i>Aperture</i>, nor charge
  them so deep as they ought. And he instances in the <i>Telescope</i>,
  which His <i>Majesty</i> of <i>Great Britain</i> presented the
  <i>Duke</i> of <i>Orleans</i> with, <i>videl.</i> that it did bear but 2
  inches, and 9 lines <i>French</i>, for its greatest <i>Aperture</i>,
  though there be 5 or 6 lesser <i>Apertures</i>, of which it seems
  (<i>saith he</i>) the Artificer would have those, that use it, serve
  themselves more ordinarily, than of the greatest; which conveys but
  almost half as many Rays as it should do, according to his Calculation,
  which is, as 9 to 16; Whereas, according to his <i>Table</i> of
  <i>Apertures</i>, an excellent 35 foot <i>Telescope</i> should bear 4
  inches <i>Aperture</i> in proportion to <i>excellent</i> small ones. He
  notes also, that the Eye-glass of the said <i>Telescope</i>, composed of
  2 Glasses, hath no more effect, when it is most charged, than a Glass of
  4½ inches; which makes it magnifie not a 100 times. And he finds by Mr.
  <i>Hook</i>, that he esteems a <i>Telescope</i> made in <i>London</i> of
  60 feet, (which amount to about 57 feet of <i>France</i>, the foot of
  <i>France</i> being to that of <i>England</i> as about 15 to 16) because
  it can bear at least 3 <i>English</i> inches <i>Aperture</i>, and that
  there are few of 30 feet, that can bear more than 2 inches, (which is but
  22½ Lines <i>French</i>) although he (M. <i>Auzout</i>) gives no less
  <i>Aperture</i> than so, to a 15 foot-<i>Telescope</i>, and his of 21
  feet hath ordinarily 2 Inches, 4 Lines, or 2 inches, 6 Lines
  <i>Aperture</i>.</p>

  <p>This Discourse he Concludeth with exhorting those, that work
  <i>Optick-Glasses</i>, to endeavor to make them such, that they may bear
  great <i>Apertures</i> and deep Eye-glasses; seeing it is not the length
  that gives esteem to <i>Telescopes</i>; but on the contrary renders them
  less estimable, by reason of the trouble <!-- Page 63 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page63"></a>{63}</span>accompanying them, if
  they perform no more, than shorter ones. Where, by the by, he takes
  notice, that he knows not yet, what <i>Aperture</i> Signor <i>Campani</i>
  gives to his Glasses, seeing he hath as yet signified nothing of it; but
  that the small one, sent by him to Cardinal <i>Antonio</i>, hath no more
  <i>Aperture</i>, than ordinary ones ought to have.</p>

  <p>He promises withall, that he will explicate this way in his
  <i>Treatise of the usefulness of Telescopes</i>, where he intends to
  assign the Bigness of the <i>Diameter</i> of all the <i>Planets</i>, and
  their proportion to that of the <i>Sun</i>; as also, that of the
  <i>Stars</i>, which he esteems yet much less, than all those have done,
  that have written of it hitherto; not believing, that the <i>Great
  Dog</i>, which appears to be the fairest Star of the <i>Firmament</i>,
  hath 2 <i>Seconds</i> in <i>Diameter</i>, nor that those, which are
  counted of the sixth Magnitude, have 20 <i>thirds</i>; nor thinking, that
  all the Stars, that are in the <i>Firmament</i>, do enlighten the Earth
  as much as a Luminous Body of 20 <i>seconds</i> in <i>Diameter</i> would
  do, or, because there is but one half of them at the same time above our
  <i>Horizon</i>, as a Body of 14 <i>seconds</i> in <i>Diameter</i>; and as
  the 18432<sup>th</sup> part of the <i>Sun</i> would enlighten us, or as
  the <i>Sun</i> would do, if we were 14 times more distant from it, than
  <i>Saturn</i>, and 137 times further, than the Earth: Which, <i>he
  saith</i>, would not be credible, if he did not endeavor to evince it
  both by <i>Experience</i> and <i>Reason</i>. And he doubts not, but that
  <i>Venus</i>, although she sends us no Light but what is reflected, does
  sometimes enlighten the <i>Earth</i> more, than all the Stars together.
  Yet he would not have us imagine, from what he hath spoken of the
  smallness of the Stars, that <i>Telescopes</i> do not magnifie them by
  reason of their great distance, as they do <i>Planets</i>; for this he
  judgeth a Vulgar Error, to be renounced. <i>Telescopes</i> magnifie the
  <i>Stars</i> (<i>saith he</i>) as much in proportion, as they do all
  other Bodies, seeing that the demonstration of their magnifying is made
  even upon <i>Parallel</i> rays, which do suppose an infinite distance,
  though the Stars have none such: And if the <i>Telescopes</i> did not
  magnifie the Stars, how could they make us see some of the
  <i>fiftieth</i>, and it may be some of the <i>hundreth</i>, and
  <i>twohundreth</i> Magnitude, as they do, and as they would shew yet much
  lesser ones, if they did magnifie more? <!-- Page 64 --><span

<h3><i></i>M<sup>r</sup>. Hook<i>'s Answer to Monsieur </i>Auzout<i>'s
Considerations, in a Letter to the Publisher
of these </i>Transactions<i>.</i></h3>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p><i>SIR</i>,</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Together with my most hearty thanks for the favour you were pleased to
  do me, in sending me an <i>Epitome</i> of what had been by the ingenious
  Monsieur <i>Auzout</i> animadverted on a description, I had made of an
  <i>Engine</i> for <i>grinding spherical Glasses</i>, I thought my self
  obliged, both for your satisfaction, and my own Vindication, to return
  you my present thoughts upon those Objections. The chief of which seems
  to be against the very <i>Proposition</i> it self: For it appears, that
  the <i>Objector</i> is somewhat unsatisfied, that I should propound a
  thing in <i>Theory</i>, without having first tried the
  <i>Practicableness</i> of it. But first, I could wish that this worthy
  Person had rectified my mistakes, not by speculation, but by experiments.
  Next, I have this to answer, that (though I did not tell the
  <i>Reader</i> so much, to the end that he might have the more freedom to
  examine and judg of the contrivance, yet) it was not meer <i>Theory</i> I
  propounded, but somewhat of <i>History</i> and <i>matter of Fact</i>:
  For, I had made trials, as many as my leisure would permit, not without
  some good success; but not having time and opportunity enough to
  prosecute them, I thought it would not be unacceptable to such, as
  enjoyed both, to have a description of a way altogether <i>New</i>, and
  <i>Geometrically</i> true, and seemingly, not unpracticable, whereof they
  might make use, or not, as they should see reason. But nothing surprised
  me so much, as, that he is pleased (after he had declared it a fault, to
  write this <i>Theory</i>, without having reduced it to practice) to lay
  it, as he seems to do, in one place of his book, <i>p.</i> 22 upon the
  <i>Royal Society</i>. Truly, <i>Sir</i>, I should think my self most
  injurious to that <i>Noble Company</i>, had I not endeavoured, even in
  the beginning of my Book, to prevent such a misconstruction. And
  therefore I cannot but make this interpretation of what Monsieur
  <i>Auzout</i> saith in this particular, that either he had not so <!--
  Page 65 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page65"></a>{65}</span>much of
  the Language wherein I have written, as to understand all what was said
  by me, or, that he had not read my <i>Dedication</i> to the <i>Royal
  Society</i>, which if he had done, he would have found, how careful I
  was, that that <i>Illustrious Society</i> should not be prejudiced by my
  <i>Errors</i>, that could be so little advantaged by my <i>Actions</i>.
  And indeed, for any man to look upon the matters published by their Order
  or Licence, as if they were <i>Their</i> Sense, and had <i>Their</i>
  Approbation, as <i>certain</i> and <i>true</i>, 'tis extremely wide of
  their intentions, seeing they, in giving way to, or encouraging such
  publications, aim chiefly at this, that <i>ingenious conceptions</i>, and
  important <i>philosophical matter of Fact</i> may be communicated to the
  learned and enquiring World, thereby to excite the minds of men to the
  examination and improvement thereof. But, to return; As to his
  <i>Objections</i> against the <i>Matter</i>, I do find that they are no
  more against mine, than any other way of <i>Grinding Glasses</i>; nor is
  it more than I have taken notice of my self in this Passage of the same
  <i>Paragraph</i>, of which sort are also those difficulties he raises
  about <i>Long Glasses</i>, which are commonly known to such, as are
  conversant in making them <i>It would be convenient also</i> (these are
  my words) <i>and not very chargeable, to have four or five several Tools:
  One,</i> &amp;c. <i>And, if curiosity shall ever proceed so farr, one for
  all lengths, between 1000. and 10000. foot long; for indeed, the
  </i>Principle<i> is such, that supposing </i>the Mandrils well<i> made,
  and of a good length, and supposing </i>great care<i> be used in working
  and polishing them, I see no reason, but that a Glass of 1000. nay,
  10000. foot long may be made, as well as one of 10. For, the reason is
  the same, supposing the </i>Mandrils<i> and </i>Tools<i> be made
  sufficiently strong, so that they cannot bend; and supposing also that
  the Glass out of which they are wrought, be capable of so great a
  regularity in its parts, as to its Refraction.</i> But next, I must say
  that his <i>Objections</i> to me, seem not so considerable, as perhaps he
  imagines them. For, as to the possibility of getting Plates of Glass
  thick and broad enough without veins, I think <i>that</i> not now so
  difficult here in <i>England</i>, where I believe is made as good, if not
  much better Glass for <i>Optical Experiments</i>, than ever I saw come
  from <i>Venice</i>. Next, though it were better, that the thickest part
  of a long <i>Object-Glass</i> were exactly in the middle, yet I can
  assure Monsieur <i>Auzout</i>, that it may be a very <!-- Page 66
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page66"></a>{66}</span>good one, when
  it is an Inch or two out of it. And I have a good one by me at present,
  of 36. foot, that will bare an <i>Aperture</i>, if <i>Saturn</i> or the
  <i>Moon</i> in the <i>twilight</i>, be look'd on with it, of 3½ Inches
  over, and yet the thickest part of the Glass is a great way out of the
  middle. And I must take the liberty to doubt, whether ever my
  <i>Animadversor</i> saw a long Glass, that was otherwise; as he might
  presently satisfie himself by a way I could shew him (if he did not know
  it) whereby the difference of the thickness of the sides might be found
  to the hundreth part of a Line.</p>

  <p>As to the exceeding exactness of the <i>Figure</i> of Long
  <i>Object-Glasses</i>, 'tis not doubted, but that it is a matter
  difficult enough to be attained any way: but yet, I think, much easier by
  <i>Engine</i>, than by <i>Hand</i>; and of all <i>Engines</i>, I
  conceive, none more plain and simple, than that of a <i>Mandril</i>. And
  for making <i>spherical Glasses</i> by an <i>Engine</i>, I am apt to
  think, there hardly can be any way more plain, and more exact, than that
  which I have described; wherein there is no other motion, than that of
  two such <i>Mandrils</i>, which may be made of sufficient strength,
  length, and exactness, to perform abundantly much more, than I can
  believe possible to be done otherwise than by chance, by a man's hands or
  strength unassisted by an <i>Engine</i>, the motion and strength being
  much more certain and regular. I know very well, that in making a 60.
  foot Glass by the strength of the hand, in the common way, not one of ten
  that are wrought, will happen to be good, as I have been assured by Mr.
  <i>Reeves</i>; who, I am apt to think, was the first that made any good
  of that length. For the <i>Figure</i> of the <i>Tool</i> in that way is
  presently vitiated by the working of the Glass, and without much
  <i>gaging</i> will not do any thing considerable. Besides, the strength
  of a man's hands, applied to it for the working and polishing of it, is
  very unequal, and the motions made, are very irregular; but in the way, I
  have ventured to propose, by <i>Mandrils</i>, the longer the <i>Glass</i>
  and <i>Tool</i> are wrought together, the more exact they seem to be and
  if all things be ordered, as they should be, the very polishing of the
  Glass, does seem most of all rectifie the <i>Figure</i>.</p>

  <p>As to what he objects, that the Tool does only touch the Glass in a
  <i>Mathematical Circle</i>; that is true, perhaps, at first, but before
  the Glass is wrought down to its true <i>Figure</i>, the <i>Edge</i> of
  the <i>Tool</i> <!-- Page 67 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page67"></a>{67}</span>will be worn or grownd away, so as that a
  Ring of an inch broad may be made to touch the <i>Spherical Surface</i>
  of the Glass; nay, if it be necessary (without much trouble, especially
  in the grinding of longer Glasses) the whole <i>Concave Surface</i> of
  the <i>Tool</i> may be made to touch a Glass. Besides, that as to the
  keeping a quantity of the same sand and Powders of several finesses,
  according as the glass wears, the same is possible to be don, as with the
  same Sand wrought finer by working in the Ordinary way.</p>

  <p>The giving the <i>Inclination</i> to the <i>Mandrils</i>, is not at
  all difficult; though perhaps to determine the length exactly which the
  Glass so made shall draw, is not so easie: But 'tis no matter, what
  length the Glass be off, so it be made good, whether 60 or 80 foot, or
  the like. Nor is it so very difficult, to lay them both in the same
  <i>Plain</i>. And to keep them <i>steddy</i>, when once fix'd, is most
  easie.</p>

  <p>As to the Calculation of the propriety of a Glass of a thousand foot,
  perhaps for that particular Length, I had not, nor have as yet
  calculated, that the Convexity of one of eighteen inches broad, will not
  be above a seventh part of a Line. But it does not thence follow, that I
  had not considered the difficulties, that would be in making of it. For,
  I must tell him, that I can make a <i>Plano convex</i> Glass though its
  convexity be a smaler sphere than is usual for such a length to be an
  <i>Object-Glass</i> of about 150 foot in Length, nay of 300 foot, and
  either longer or shorter, <i>without</i> at all <i>altering the
  convexity</i>. So that, if he will by any Contrivance he hath, give me a
  <i>Plano-convex</i> Glass of 20, or 40 foot <i>Diameter</i>, without
  <i>Veins</i>, and truly wrought of that <i>Figure</i>, I will presently
  make a <i>Telescope</i> with it, that with a single Ey-glass shall draw a
  thousand foot: Which <i>Invention</i>, I shall shortly discover, there
  being, I think, nothing more easie and certain. And if a
  <i>Plano-convex</i> Glass can be made of any <i>Sphere</i> between twenty
  and fourty foot <i>radius</i>, so as that both the <i>Convex</i> and
  <i>Plain</i> side of the Glass be exactly polish'd of a true
  <i>Figure</i>, I will shortly shew, how therewith may be made a
  <i>Telescope</i> of any Length, supposing the Glass free from all kind of
  <i>Veins</i>, or inequality of <i>Refraction</i>.</p>

  <p>As for the sliding of the Glass upon the <i>Cement</i>, I see no
  reason at all for it, at least in the <i>Cement</i>, I make use of,
  having never observed any such accident in hard <i>Cement</i>. <!-- Page
  68 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page68"></a>{68}</span></p>

  <p>And for the Bearing of the <i>Ring</i> against one side of the Glass
  only at a time, I cannot see, why <i>that</i> should produce any
  inequality, since all the sides of the Glass have successively the same
  pressure.</p>

  <p>His ratiocination concerning a Glass of 300 foot, is much the same
  with the former, about the difficulty of working a true surface of a
  convenient figure; which how considerable both <i>that</i> and his
  Conclusion thereupon (<i>videl. That we are not to expect Glasses of
  above 300 or 400 foot long at most, and that neither </i>Matter<i> nor
  </i>Art<i> will go so far</i>) is, may be judged from what I have newly
  told you of making any <i>Object-Glass</i> of any Length.</p>

  <p>And for his good wishes, that those, who promise to make him see
  <i>Plants</i> or <i>Animals</i> in the <i>Moon</i> (of which I know not
  any, that has done so, though perhaps there may be some, notwithstanding
  his Objections, that do not yet think it impossible to be done) had
  considered, what a Man is able to see with his <i>bare</i> Eye at 60
  Leagues distance: I cannot but return him my wishes, that he would
  consider the difference between seeing a thing through the <i>Gross</i>
  and <i>Vaporous</i> Air neer the Earth, and through the Air over our
  heads: Which, if he observe the Moon in the <i>Horizon</i>, and neer the
  <i>Zenith</i> with a <i>Telescope</i>, he will experimentally find; and,
  having done so, he will perhaps not be so dissident in this matter.</p>

  <p>Concerning his Advertisement to such, as publish <i>Theories</i>, I
  find not, that he hath made use of it in his own case. For, in his
  <i>Theory</i> about <i>Apertures</i> he seems to be very positive, not at
  all doubting to rely upon it, <i>vid.</i> that the <i>Apertures</i> must
  be <i>thus</i> and <i>thus</i> in <i>great</i> Glasses, because he had
  found them <i>so</i> or <i>so</i> in some <i>small</i> ones.</p>

  <p>For his Proposal of amendments of some inconveniencies in this way, I
  return him my thanks; but as to his first I believe, that the matter may
  be conteined as wel in the <i>Concave</i> Tool, as on the <i>convex</i>
  Glass. And as to that of 2 <i>Poppet-heads</i> I do not well understand
  it, if differing from mine; and the keeping of the Tool upon the Glass
  with a spring or weight, must quickly spoyl the whole; since, if either
  of the <i>Mandrils</i> will easily yield backwards, the <i>regularity</i>
  of <i>all</i> will be spoiled: and as to the wrigling and playing of the
  <i>Mandril</i>, I do not at all apprehend it. <!-- Page 69 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page69"></a>{69}</span></p>

  <p>His <i>Theory</i> of <i>Apertures</i>, though he seems to think it
  very authentick, yet to me it seems not so cleer. For, the same Glass
  will endure greater or lesser <i>Apertures</i>, according to the lesser
  or greater Light of the <i>Object</i>: If it be for the looking on the
  <i>Sun</i> or <i>Venus</i>, or for seeing the <i>Diameters</i> of the
  <i>Fix'd Stars</i>, then smaller <i>Apertures</i> do better; if for the
  <i>Moon</i> in the <i>daylight</i>, or on <i>Saturn</i>, or
  <i>Jupiter</i>, or <i>Mars</i>, then the largest. Thus I have often made
  use of a 12 foot-Glass to look on <i>Saturn</i> with an <i>Aperture</i>
  of almost 3 inches, and with a single Eye-glass of 2 inches <i>double
  convex</i>: but, when with the same Glass I looked on the <i>Sun</i> or
  <i>Venus</i>, I used both a smaller <i>Aperture</i>, and shallower
  <i>Charge</i>. And though M. <i>Auzout</i> seems to find fault with the
  <i>English</i> Glass of 36 foot, that had an <i>Aperture</i> of but 2¾
  inches <i>French</i>; as also, with a 60 foot <i>Tube</i>, used but with
  an <i>Aperture</i> of 3 inches; yet I do not find, that he hath seen
  Glasses of that length, that would bear greater <i>Apertures</i>, and
  'tis not impossible, but his <i>Theory</i> of <i>Apertures</i> may fail
  in longer Glasses.</p>

<h3><i>Of a means to illuminate an Object in what proportion
one pleaseth; and of the Distances requisite
to burn Bodies by the </i>Sun<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>One of the means used by M. <i>Auzout</i> to enlighten an Object, in
  what proportion one pleaseth, is by some great <i>Object-Glass</i>, by
  him called a <i>Planetary</i> one, because that by it he shews the
  difference of Light, which all the <i>Planets</i> receive from the
  <i>Sun</i>, by making use of several <i>Apertures</i>, proportionate to
  their distance from the <i>Sun</i>, provided that for every 9 foot
  draught, or thereabout, one inch of <i>Aperture</i> be given for the
  <i>Earth</i>. Doing this, one sees (<i>saith he</i>) that the Light which
  <i>Mercury</i> receives, is far enough from being able to burn Bodies,
  and yet that the same Light is great enough in <i>Saturn</i> to see cleer
  there, seeing that (to him) it appears greater in <i>Saturn</i>, than it
  doth upon our <i>Earth</i>, when it is overcast with Clouds: Which (he
  adds) would scarce be believed, if by means of this Glass it did not
  sensibly appear so; Whereof he promises to discourse more fully in his
  <!-- Page 70 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page70"></a>{70}</span><i>Treatise of the usefulness of great
  Optick-Glasses</i>, where he also intends to deliver several Experiments,
  by him made, 1. Touching the quantity of Light, which a Body, that is 10,
  15 and 20 times, <i>&amp;c.</i> remoter than <i>Saturn</i>, would yet
  receive from the <i>Sun</i>. 2. Touching the quantity of Light, by which
  the <i>Earth</i> is illuminated even in the <i>Eclipses</i> of the
  <i>Sun</i>, in proportion of their bigness. 3. Touching the quantity of
  Light, which is necessary to burn Bodies: he having found, that not
  abating the Light, which is reflected by the Surfaces of the Glass
  (whereof he confesseth, he doth not yet exactly know the quantity) there
  would be necessary about 50 times as much Light, as we have here, for the
  burning of <i>Black</i> Bodies; and neer 9 times more for the burning of
  <i>White</i> Bodies, than for the burning of <i>Black</i> ones: and so
  observing the immediate proportions between these two, for burning bodies
  of <i>other</i> Colors. Whence (he tells us) he hath drawn some
  consequences, touching the distance, at which we may hope, to burn Bodies
  here, by the means of <i>great Glasses</i> and great
  <i>Looking-glasses</i>. So that (<i>saith he</i>) we must yet be seven
  times neerer the <i>Sun</i>, than we are, to be in danger of being burned
  by it. Where he mentions, that having given <i>Instructions</i> to
  certain persons, gon to travel in <i>Hot Countries</i>, he hath among
  other particulars recommended to them, to try by means of great
  <i>Burning-glasses</i>, with how much less <i>Aperture</i> they will burn
  <i>there</i>, than <i>here</i>, to know from thence, whether there by
  more Light <i>there</i> than <i>here</i>, and how much; since this
  perhaps may be the only means of trying it, supposing, the same matters
  be used: although the difference of the Air already heated, both in
  <i>hot Countries</i>, and in the <i>Planets</i>, that are neerer than we,
  may alter, if not the quantity of Light, at least that of the Heat, found
  there.</p>

<h3><i>A further Account, touching Signor </i>Campani<i>'s Book and
Performances about </i>Optick-glasses<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>In the above-mentioned <i>French</i> Tract there is also conteined M.
  <i>Auzout's</i> Opinion of what he had found New in the <i>Treatise</i>
  of Signor <i>Campani</i>, which was spoken of in the first <i>Papers</i>
  of these <i>Transactions</i>, concerning both the Effect of the
  <i>Telescopes</i>, contrived after a peculiar way by the said
  <i>Campani</i> at <i>Rome</i>, and <!-- Page 71 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page71"></a>{71}</span>his New Observations of
  <i>Saturn</i> and <i>Jupiter</i>, made by means thereof.</p>

  <p>First therefore, after that M <i>Auzout</i> had raised some scruple
  against the Contrivance of Signor <i>Campani</i> for making <i>Great
  Optick-Glasses</i> without <i>Moulds</i>, by the means of a
  <i>Turn-lath</i>, he examines the <i>Observations</i>, made with such
  <i>Glasses</i>: Where, having commended <i>Campani</i>'s sincerity in
  relating what he thought to have seen in <i>Saturn</i>, without
  accomodating it to M. <i>Hugens</i>'s <i>Hypothesis</i>, he affirms, that
  supposing, there be a <i>Ring</i> about <i>Saturn</i>, Signor
  <i>Campani</i> could not see in all those different times, that he
  observed it, <i>the same Appearances</i>, which he notes to have
  <i>actually</i> seen. For, having seen it sometimes in <i>Trine
  Aspect</i> with the <i>Sun</i>, and <i>Oriental</i>; sometimes, in the
  same <i>Aspect</i>, but <i>Occidental</i>; sometimes in <i>Sextil
  Aspect</i>, and <i>Occidental</i>; at another time, again in
  <i>Trine</i>, and <i>Oriental</i>, this Author cannot conceive, how
  <i>Saturn</i> could in all these different times have no difference in
  its <i>Phasis</i>, or keep always the same <i>Shadow</i>; seeing that,
  according to the <i>Hypothesis</i> of the <i>Ring</i>, when it was
  <i>Oriental</i>, it must cast the <i>Shadow</i> upon the <i>left</i> side
  of the <i>Ring</i> beneath, without casting any on the <i>right</i> side:
  and when it was <i>Occidental</i>, it could not but cast it on the
  <i>right</i> side beneath, and nothing of it on the other.</p>

  <p>Concerning the <i>Shadow above</i>, which <i>Campani</i> affirms to be
  made by the <i>Ring</i> upon the Body of <i>Saturn</i>, M. <i>Auzout</i>
  judges, that there could be no such <i>Phænomenon</i>, by reason of its
  <i>Northern Latitude</i> at the times, wherein the <i>Observations</i>
  were made, <i>vid.</i> in <i>April</i> 1663; in the midst of
  <i>August</i>, and the beginning of <i>October</i>, next following, and
  in <i>April</i> 1664, except it were in <i>October</i>, and the
  <i>Shadow</i> strong enough to become <i>visible</i>.</p>

  <p>But as to the <i>Shadow below</i>, he agrees with <i>Campani</i>, that
  it does appear, yet not as he notes it, seeing that it must be sometimes
  on the one side, sometimes on the other; and towards the <i>Quadrat</i>
  with the <i>Sun</i> it must appear biggest, as <i>indeed</i> he affirms
  to have seen it himself <i>this</i> year, insomuch that sometimes it
  seemed to him, that it covered the whole <i>Ring</i>, and that the
  <i>Shadow</i>, joyning with the obscure space between both, did interrupt
  the circumference of the <i>Ring</i>; but beholding it at other times in
  a cleer Sky, and when there was no Trepidation of the Air, <!-- Page 72
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page72"></a>{72}</span>he thought, that
  he saw also the Light continued from without, although very slender. But
  he acknowledges, that he could never yet <i>precisely</i> determine, by
  how much the largeness of the <i>Ring</i> was bigger than the
  <i>Diameter</i> of <i>Saturn's</i> Body. As for the proportion of the
  Length to the Breadth, he affirms, to have alwaies estimated it to be two
  and a half, or very neer so; and to have found in his
  <i>Observations</i>, that in <i>January</i> last, one time, the length of
  <i>Saturn</i> was 12 <i>Lines</i>, and the breadth 5. Another time, the
  length was 12. <i>Lines</i>, and the breadth 4. and this by a peculiar
  method of his own. But yet he acknowleges also, that sometimes he hath
  estimated it as 7. to 3. and at other times as 13. to 5. and that if
  there do not happen a change in the magnitude of the <i>Ring</i> (as it
  is not likely there does) that must needs proceed from the Constitution
  of the air, or of the Glass's having more or less <i>Aperture</i>, or
  from the difficulty of making an exact estimate of their proportions.
  However it is not much wide (saith he) of two and a half, although
  <i>Campani</i> make the length of the <i>Ring</i> but double to its
  breadth.</p>

  <p>Monsieur <i>Auzout</i> believes, that he was one of the first that
  have well observed this shadow of <i>Saturn's</i> Body upon its
  <i>Rings</i> which he affirms happened two years since; when, observing
  in <i>July</i>, for the first time, with a <i>Telescope</i> of 21. and
  then another of 27. foot, he perceived, that the <i>Angle</i> of the
  obscure space on the <i>right side</i> beneath, was bigger and wider,
  than the three other <i>Angles</i>, and that some interruption appear'd
  <i>there</i>, between the <i>Ring</i>, and the <i>Body of Saturn</i>; of
  which he saith to have given notice from that time to all his friends,
  and in particular, as soon as conveniently he could, to Monsieur
  <i>Hugens</i>.</p>

  <p>He confesseth, that he hath not had the opportunity of observing
  <i>Saturn</i> in his <i>Oriental Quadrat</i>; yet he doubts not, but that
  the <i>shadow</i> appears on the <i>Left-side</i>, considering, that the
  <i>Existence</i> of the <i>Ring</i> can be no longer doubted of, after so
  many <i>Observations</i> of the <i>shadow</i> cast by <i>Saturn's</i>
  Body upon it, according as it must happen, following that
  <i>Hypothesis</i>; there being no reason, why it should cast the said
  <i>shadow</i> on one side, and not on the other.</p>

  <p>Concerning the Observation of <i>Jupiter</i> and its
  <i>satellites</i>, the famous <i>Astronomer</i> of <i>Bononia</i>,
  <i>Cassinus</i>, having <!-- Page 73 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page73"></a>{73}</span>published, that on the 30. day of
  <i>July</i>, 1664. at 2½ of the clock in the morning, he had observ'd,
  with <i>Campani</i>'s Glasses, that there passed through the broad
  obscure <i>Belt</i> of <i>Jupiter</i> two obscurer <i>spots</i>, by him
  esteemed to be the <i>shadows</i> of the <i>Satellites</i>, moving
  between <i>Jupiter</i> &amp; the <i>Sun</i>, and eclipsing him, and
  emerging from the Occidental Brim thereof: This <i>Authour</i> did first
  conceive, that they were not <i>shadows</i>, but some <i>Sallies</i>, or
  <i>Prominencies</i> in that <i>Belt</i>; which he was induced to believe,
  because he perceived not, that that <i>Prominency</i>, which he there
  saw, was so black, nor so round as <i>Cassini</i> had represented his
  <i>spots</i>; wherefore, seeing it but little differing in colour, from
  the <i>Belt</i>, and so not judging it round, because it did stand only
  about half its diameter out of the <i>Belt</i>, he persuaded himself,
  that it was rather a <i>Sally</i>, or <i>Prominency</i> of the
  <i>Belt</i>, than a round <i>shadow</i>, as that of a <i>Satellite</i> of
  <i>Jupiter</i> must have bin. But having been since informed of
  <i>all</i> the <i>Observations</i> made by <i>Cassini</i> and
  <i>Campani</i>, with the <i>New</i> Glasses, and seen his <i>Figure</i>,
  he candidly and publickly wisheth, that he had not spoken of that
  <i>Sally</i>, or <i>Prominency</i>; advowing that he can doubt no longer,
  but that it was the <i>shadow</i> of the <i>Satellit</i> between
  <i>Jupiter</i> and the <i>Sun</i>, having seen the other emerge, as soon
  as with a 20. foot Glass he made the Observation, and having not
  perceiv'd these <i>shadows</i> with a 12. foot Glass: But although he
  grants that they did ghess better than he, yet he doth it with this
  <i>proviso</i>, <i>vid.</i> in case they made <i>that</i> Observation on
  of <i>July</i> 30. not with their 36. but 12. or 17. foot
  <i>Telescope</i>. If it be wondred at, that Monsieur <i>Auzout</i> did
  not see this <i>shadow</i> move, he allegeth his indisposition for making
  <i>long Observations</i>, and addeth, that it may be much more wondred
  at, that neither <i>Campani</i> nor himself did see upon the obscure
  <i>Belt</i> the Bodies of the <i>Satellites</i>, as parts more Luminous
  than the <i>Belt</i>. For (saith he) although the <i>Latitude</i> was
  <i>Meridional</i>, it being no more than of 9. or 10. minutes, the Body
  of the <i>Satellites</i> should, thinks he, pass between <i>us</i> and
  the <i>Belt</i>, especially according to <i>Campani</i>, who maketh the
  <i>Belt</i> so large, and puts the <i>shadows</i> farr enough within the
  same. This maketh him conclude, that either they have not observed well
  enough, or that the motion of the <i>Satellites</i> doth not exactly
  follow the <i>Belts</i>, and is inclin'd unto them. Whereupon he
  resolves, that when he shall know that they are to pass between
  <i>Jupiter</i> and <i>us</i>, and to be over against the <i>Belt</i>,
  that <!-- Page 74 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page74"></a>{74}</span>then he will observe, whether he can see
  them appear upon the <i>Belt</i>, as upon a darker ground, especially,
  the <i>third</i> of them, which is sensibly greater, and more Luminous,
  than the rest. He hopeth also, that in time, the <i>shadow</i> of
  <i>Saturns Moon</i> will be seen upon <i>Saturn</i>, although we are yet
  some years to stay for it, and to prepare also for better Glasses.</p>

  <p>From this rare Observation, he inferrs the <i>Proportion</i> of the
  <i>Diameter</i> of the <i>Satellites</i> to that of <i>Jupiter</i>; and
  judgeth, that no longer doubt can be made of the turning of these 4.
  <i>Satellites</i>, or <i>Moons</i> about <i>Jupiter</i>, as our
  <i>Moon</i> turns about the <i>Earth</i>, and after the same way as the
  rest of the Celestial Bodies of our <i>Systeme</i> do move: whence also a
  strong conjecture may be made, that <i>Saturns</i> Moon turns likewise
  about <i>Saturn</i>.</p>

  <p>Hence he also taketh occasion to intimate, that we need not scruple to
  conclude, that if these two <i>Planets</i> have <i>Moons</i> wheeling
  about them, as our <i>Earth</i> hath one that moves about it, the
  conformity of these <i>Moons</i> with our <i>Moon</i>, does prove the
  conformity of our <i>Earth</i> with those <i>Planets</i>, which carrying
  away their <i>Moons</i> with themselves, do turn about the <i>Sun</i>,
  and very probably make their <i>Moons</i> turn about them in turning
  themselves about their <i>Axis</i>; and also, that there is no cause to
  invent perplex'd and incredible <i>Hypotheses</i>, for the receding from
  this <i>Analogie</i> since (saith he) if this be truth, the Prohibitions
  of publishing this doctrine, which formerly were caused by the offence of
  Novelty, will be laid aside, as one of the most zealous Doctors of the
  contrary Opinion hath given cause to hope, witness <i>Eustachius de
  Divinis</i>, in his <i>Tract</i> against Monsieur <i>Hugen</i>'s
  <i>Systeme</i> of <i>Saturn</i>, <i>p.</i> 49. where we are inform'd,
  that that learned Jesuit, <i>P. Fabry</i>, Penitentiary of S <i>Peter</i>
  in <i>Rome</i>, speaks to this purpose:</p>

  doth find no reason to doubt any more of the excellency of the Glass used
  by them, above his; except this difference may be imputed to that of the
  <i>Air</i>, or of the <i>Eys</i>. But yet he is rather inclined to
  ascribe it to the goodness of their Glasses, and that the rather,
  because, he would not be thought to have the vanity of magnifying his
  own; of which, yet he intimates by the by, that he caused one to be
  wrought, of 150 <i>Parisian</i> feet; which though it proved none of the
  best, yet he despairs not to make good ones of <i>that</i>, and of far
  greater Length.</p>

<h3><i></i>Signor Campani's<i> Answer: and Monsieur
</i>Auzout<i>'s Animadversions thereon.</i></h3>

  <p>The other part of this <i>French Tract</i>, conteining
  <i>Campani</i>'s Answer, and Mr. <i>Auzout</i> his <i>Reflections</i>
  thereon, begins with the pretended <i>Shadows</i> of the <i>Ring</i> upon
  <i>Saturn</i>, and of <i>Saturn</i> upon the <i>Ring</i>. Concerning
  which, the said <i>Campani</i> declareth, that he never believed them to
  be <i>shadows</i>, made by the <i>Ring</i> upon the <i>Disk</i> of
  <i>Saturn</i>, or by the body of <i>Saturn</i> upon the <i>Ring</i>, but
  the <i>Rimms</i> of these bodies, which being <i>unequally</i> Luminous,
  did shew these appearances. In which Explication, forasmuch as it
  represents, that the said <i>Campani</i> meant to note only the
  <i>Inequality of the Light</i>, which, <i>he saith</i>, his Glasses did
  discover, Mr. <i>Auzout</i> does <!-- Page 76 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page76"></a>{76}</span>so far acquiesce, that he only wishes, that
  his own Glasses would shew him those differences. Next to the Objection,
  made by Monsieur <i>Auzout</i>, against Signor <i>Campani</i>, touching
  the Proportion of the Length of the <i>Ring</i> to its breadth,
  <i>Campani</i> replyeth, that the Glasses of Monsieur <i>Auzout</i>, shew
  not all the particulars, that his do, and therefore are unfit for
  determining the true Figure and breadth of the apparent <i>Ellipsis</i>
  of the <i>Ring</i>. To which M. <i>Auzout</i> rejoyns, that he is
  displeased at his being destitute of better Glasses, but that it will be
  very hard for the future to convince <i>Campani</i> touching the
  <i>Proportion</i> of the <i>Ring</i>, seing that the breadth of the
  <i>Ellipsis</i> is always diminishing, although, if the declination of
  the <i>Ring</i> remains always the same, one can at all times know, which
  may have been its greatest breadth. But he assures, that the breadth of
  the <i>Ring</i> is not the half of its length, and that it doth not
  spread out so much beyond <i>Saturn</i>'s Body, as he hath alleged. And
  withal desirs to know, what can be answered by Sig. <i>Campani</i> to M.
  <i>Hugens</i>, who being persuaded, that the Declination of the
  <i>Ring</i> is not above 23 deg. 30&prime; having seen the <i>Ring</i> to
  spread out above the Body of <i>Saturn</i>, concludes, in a Letter to M.
  <i>Auzout</i>, that the length of the <i>Ring</i> is more than treble the
  <i>Diameter</i> of <i>Saturn</i>'s body, which, according to
  <i>Campani</i>, is only as about 67 to 31. Which difference yet dos not
  appear to M. <i>Auzout</i> to be so great; but that M. <i>Hugens</i>
  perhaps will impute it to the Optical reason, which he (<i>Auzout</i>)
  hath alleged of the Advance of the light upon the obscure space; although
  he is of Opinion, he should not have concluded so great a Length, if he
  had not seen the Breadth spread out more, than he hath done: for
  (<i>saith he</i>) if the Length of the <i>Ring</i> be to the body of
  <i>Saturn</i>, 2½ to 1. and the <i>Inclination</i> be 23 deg. 30&prime;
  the <i>Ring</i> will be just as large, as the body, without spreading
  out; but if the <i>Ring</i> be bigger, it will a little spread out; and
  if it were treble, it must needs spread out the half of its breadth,
  which hath not so appeared to him.</p>

  <p>Further, to M. <i>Auzout's</i> change of Opinion, and believing, that
  the <i>Advance</i> or <i>Sally</i>, seen by him in <i>Jupiter</i>, was
  the <i>Shadow</i> of one of his Moons, <i>Campani</i> declares, that he
  would not have him guilty of that change: Whereupon M. <i>Auzout</i>
  wonders, why <i>Campani</i> then hath not marked it in his <i>Figure</i>;
  and would <!-- Page 77 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page77"></a>{77}</span>gladly know, whether that <i>Sally</i> be
  more easie to discover, than the <i>Shadows</i> of the <i>Satellites</i>,
  which <i>Campani</i> believs, <i>Auzout</i> hath not seen; and whether he
  be assured, that those obscure parts, which he there distinguishes, do
  not change: for if they should not change, then <i>Jupiter</i> would not
  turn about his <i>Axis</i>, which yet, he saith, it doth, according to
  the <i>Observation</i> made by Mr. <i>Hook</i>, <i>May</i> 9 1664.
  inserted in the first papers of these <i>Transactions</i>. The full
  Discovery of which particular also he makes to be a part of
  <i>Cassini's</i> and <i>Campani</i>'s work, seeing that they so
  distinctly see the inequalities in the <i>Belts</i>, and see also
  sometimes other <i>Spots</i> besides the <i>Shadows</i> of the
  <i>Satellites</i>: where he exhorts all the Curious, that have the
  conveniency of observing, to endeavor the discovery of a matter of that
  importance, which would prove one of the greatest <i>Analogies</i> for
  the <i>Earth's Motion</i>.</p>

<h3><i>An Account, how </i>Adits<i> &amp; </i>Mines<i> are wrought
at </i>Liege<i> without </i>Air-shafts<i>, communicated
by Sir </i>Robert Moray<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>It is well known to those conversant in <i>Mines</i>, that there is
  nothing of greater inconvenience in the working or <i>driving</i>, as
  they call it, of <i>Mines</i> or <i>Adits</i> under ground, for carrying
  away of Water, or such <i>Minerals</i> as the <i>Mine</i> affords, than
  the <i>Damp, want,</i> and <i>impurity of Air,</i> that <!-- Page 80
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page80"></a>{80}</span>occur, when such
  <i>Adits</i> are wrought or driven inward upon a <i>Level</i>, or near
  it, 20, 30, or 40. fathom, more or less. Aswel because of the expence of
  money, as of time also, in the <i>Ordinary</i> way of preventing or
  remedying those inconveniences; which is, by letting down <i>shafts</i>
  from the <i>day</i> (as <i>Miners</i> speak) to meet with the
  <i>Adit</i>; by which means the Air hath liberty to play through the
  whole work, and so takes away bad vapours and furnishes good Air for
  Respiration. The Expence of which <i>shafts</i>, in regard of their vast
  depth, hardness of the Rock, drawing of water, <i>&amp;c.</i> doth
  sometimes equal, yea exceed the <i>ordinary</i> charge of the whole
  <i>Adit</i>.</p>

  <p>Amongst the <i>Expedients</i> that have been devised to remedy this,
  there is one practised in the <i>Coal-mines</i>, near the Town of
  <i>Liege</i> (or <i>Luyck</i>) that seems preferable to all others for
  Efficacy, Ease, and Cheapness: the description whereof followeth.</p>

  <p>At the mouth or entry of the <i>Adit</i> there is a structure raised
  of <i>Brick</i>, like a <i>Chimney</i>, some 28. or 30. foot high in all:
  at the bottom, two opposite sides are (or may be) some 5½ foot broad; and
  the other two, 5. foot: the wall 1½ <i>Brick</i> thick. At the lower part
  of it, is a hole, some 9. or 10. inches square, for taking out of the
  Ashes, which when it is done, this Ash-hole is immediately stopt so
  close, as Air cannot possibly get in at any part of it. Then, some 3.
  foot above ground or more, there is on that side, that is next to the
  <i>Adit</i> or Pit, a square hole of 8. or 9. inches every way, by which
  the Air enters to make the Fire burn: Into this hole there is fixed a
  square <i>Tube</i> or <i>Pipe</i> of Wood, whereof the Joints and Chinks
  are so stopt with Parchment pasted or glewed upon them, that the Air can
  no where get in to the Pipe but at the end: And this Pipe is still
  lengthened, as the <i>Adit</i> or Pit advanceth, by fitting the new Pipes
  so, as one end is alwaies thrust into the other, and the Joints and
  Chinks still carefully cemented and stopt as before. So the Pipe or Tube
  being still carried on, as near as is necessary, to the wall or place,
  where fresh Air is requisite; the Fire within the Chimney doth still
  attract <!-- Page 81 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page81"></a>{81}</span>(so to speak) Air through the Tube, without
  which it cannot burn, which yet it will do, as is obvious to conceive
  (all Illustrations and Philosophical Explications being here
  superfluous,) and so, while the Air is drawn by the fire from the
  farthest or most inward part of the <i>Mine</i> or <i>Adit</i>, fresh Air
  must needs come in from without to supply the place of the other, which
  by its motion doth carry away with it all the ill vapors, that breath out
  of the ground; by which meanes the whole <i>Adit</i> will be alwaies
  filled with fresh Air, so that men will there breath as surely as abroad,
  and not only Candles burn, but Fire, when upon occasion there is use for
  it for breaking of the Rock.</p>

  <p>Now that there may be no want of such fresh Air, the Fire must alwaies
  be kept burning in the Chimney, or at least as frequently as is
  necessary: For which purpose there must be two of the Iron Grates or
  Chimneys, that when any accident befals the one, the other may be ready
  to be in its place, the Coals being first well kindled in it: but when
  the fire is neer spent, the Chimney or Grate being haled up to the dore,
  is to be supplied with fresh fuel.</p>

  <p>The Figure of the Fabrick, Chimney, and all the parts thereof being
  hereunto annexed, the rest will be easily understood.</p>

  <p>Though the invention of breaking with ease, and dispatch, hard Rocks,
  may be useful on several occasions, the benefit is incomparably great,
  that may thereby accrue to those, who have <i>Adits</i> or Passages to
  cut through hard <i>Rocks</i>, for making passage for Water to run out
  by, in <i>Mines</i> of <i>Lead</i>, <i>Tin</i>, or any other whatsoever;
  these <i>Adits</i> appearing to be the surest, cheapest, and most
  advantagious way imaginable, for draining of the same. <!-- Page 83
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page83"></a>{83}</span></p>

  <p>That which is here to be described, was invented by one of the most
  Excellent <i>Mechanicks</i> in the World, <i>Monsieur du Son</i>, who
  lately put it in practice himself in <i>Germany</i>, at the desire of the
  <i>Elector</i> of <i>Mentz</i>. The manner is, as followeth.</p>

  <p>The <i>Mine</i> or <i>Adit</i> is to be made seven or eight foot high,
  which though it seem to make more work downwards, yet will be found
  necessary for making the better dispatch by rendring the Invention more
  effectual.</p>

  <p>There is a <i>Tool</i> or <i>Iron</i> well steeled at the end, which
  cuts the Rock, (of the shape shewed by <i>Fig.</i> 2. here annexed,) 20.
  or 22. Inches long or more, and some 2½ Inches <i>Diameter</i> at the
  steeled end, the rest being somewhat more slender. The steeled end is so
  shaped, as makes it most apt to pierce the Rock, the Angles at that end
  being still to be made the more obtuse, the harder the Rock is. This
  <i>Tool</i> is to be first held by the hand, in the place, where the
  Hole, to be made for the use, which shall here be shewed, is to be
  placed; that is, in the middle between the sides of the Rock, that is to
  be cut, but as near the bottom as may be. The <i>Tool</i> being placed,
  is to be struck upon with an Hammer, the heavier the better, either
  suspended by a Shaft turning upon a Pin, or otherwise, so as one man may
  manage the Hammer, while another holds the Tool or Piercer. If it be hung
  in a <i>Frame</i>, or other convenient way, he that manageth it hath no
  more to do, but to pull it up at first as high as he can, and let it fall
  again by its own weight, the motion being so directed, as to be sure to
  hit the Piercer right. After the stroke of the Hammer, he that holds the
  Piercer, is to turn it a little on its point; so that the Edges or Angles
  at the point may all strike upon a new place; and so it must still be
  shifted after every stroke, by which means small Chipps will at every
  stroke be broken off, which must from time to time be taken out, as need
  requires. And thus the work must be continued, till the <i>Hole</i> be
  18. or 20. Inches deep, the deeper the better. This <i>Hole</i> being
  made as deep as is required, and kept as streight and smooth in the
  sides, as is possible, there is then a kind of double <i>Wedge</i> to be
  made, and <!-- Page 84 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page84"></a>{84}</span>fitted exactly for it; the shape whereof is
  to be seen in the annexed 3. Figure.</p>

  <div class="figleft" style="width:12%;">
      <a href="images/VI_N5_Fig3.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/VI_N5_Fig3.png"
      alt="Figure 3." title="Figure 3." /></a>
  </div>
  <p>This double <i>Wedge</i>, being 12. or 13. Inches long, each piece of
  it, and so made, as being placed in their due position they may make up a
  <i>Cylinder</i>, but <i>Diagonal</i>-wise. The two flat sides that are
  contiguous, are to be greased or oyled, that the one may slip the more
  easily upon the other; and one of them, which is to be uppermost, having
  at the great end a hollow <i>Crease</i> cut into it round about, for
  fastening a <i>Cartridge</i>, full of <i>Gunpowder</i>, to it with a
  thred, the round end of the <i>Wedge</i> being pared as much as the
  thickness of the Paper or Pastboard, that holds the Powder, needs to make
  the outside thereof <i>even</i> with the rest of the <i>Wedge</i>. This
  <i>Wedge</i> must have an Hole drilled through the longest side of it, to
  be filled with <i>priming Powder</i>, for firing of the Powder in the
  <i>Cartridge</i>; which needs have no more, than half a pound of Powder,
  though upon occasion a greater quantity may be used, as shall be found
  requisite.</p>

  <p>Then this <i>Wedge</i>, being first thrust into the Hole with the
  <i>Cartridge</i>, the round side, whether the Priming-hole is, being
  uppermost, the other <i>Wedge</i> is to be thrust in, home to the due
  position, care being taken, that they fit the Hole in the Rock as exactly
  as may be. Then the end of the lower <i>Wedge</i> being about an Inch
  longer, than that of the upper outwardly, and flatned, priming Powder is
  to be laid upon it; and a piece of burning <i>Match</i> or <i>Thread</i>
  dipt in <i>Brimstone</i> or other such prepared combustible Matter,
  fastned to it, that may burn so long before it fire the Powder, as he,
  that orders it, may have time enough to retire quite out the Pit or
  <i>Adit</i>, having first placed a piece of Wood or Iron so, as one end
  thereof, being set against the end of the lower Wedge, and the other
  against the side-wall, so as it cannot slip. Which being done, and the
  Man retired, when the Powder comes to take fire, it will first drive out
  the uppermost Wedge, as far as it will go, but the slaunting figure of it
  being so made, as the farther it goes backward, the thicker it grows,
  till at the last it can go no farther, then the <!-- Page 85 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page85"></a>{85}</span>fire tears the Rock to
  get forth, and so cracks and breaks it all about, that at one time a vast
  deal of it will either be quite blown out, or so crackt and broken, as
  will make it easie to be remov'd: And according to the effect of one such
  <i>Cartridge</i>, more may be afterwards made use of, as hath been
  said.</p>

<h3><i>Observables upon a </i>Monstrous Head<i>.</i></h3>

  <div class="figright" style="width:45%;">
      <a href="images/VI_N5_Fig4.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/VI_N5_Fig4.png"
      alt="Figure 4." title="Figure 4." /></a>
  </div>
  <p>This was the Head of a <i>Colt</i>, represented in the annexed
  <i>Figure</i> 4. first viewed by Mr. <i>Boyle</i>, who went into the
  Stable where the <i>Colt</i> lay, and got the Head hastily and rudely cut
  off, the <i>Body</i> thereof appearing to his Eye compleately formed,
  without any <i>Monstrosity</i> to be taken notice of in it. Afterwards he
  caused it to be put into a Vessel, and covered with <i>Spirit of Wine</i>
  thereby chiefly intending, to give good example, together with a proof,
  that by the help of the said <i>Spirit</i>, (which he hath recommended
  for such Properties in one of his <i>Essays</i> of the <i>Usefulness</i>
  of <i>Natural Philosophy</i>) the parts of <i>Animals</i>, and even
  <i>Monsters</i>, may in <i>Summer</i> it self be preserved long enough to
  afford <i>Anatomists</i> the opportunities of examining them.</p>

  <p>The Head being opened, and examined, it was found.</p>

  <p><i>First</i>, That it had no sign of any <i>Nose</i> in the usual
  place, nor had it any, in any other place of the Head, unless the double
  Bag CC, that grew out of the midst of the forehead, were some rudiment of
  it.</p>

  <p><i>Next</i>, That the <i>two Eyes</i> were united into one <i>Double
  Eye</i>, which was placed just in the middle of the Brow, the Nose being
  wanting, which should have separated them, whereby the two Eye-holes in
  the Scull were united into one very large round hole, into the midst of
  which, from the Brain, entred one pretty large <i>Optik Nerve</i>, at the
  end of which grew a great <i>Double Eye</i>; that is, that
  <i>Membrane</i>, called <i>Sclerotis</i>, which contained both, was one
  and the same, but seemed to have a <i>Seam</i>, <!-- Page 86 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page86"></a>{86}</span>by which they were
  joined, to go quite round it, and the fore or pellucid part was
  distinctly separated into two <i>Cornea</i>'s by a white <i>Seam</i> that
  divided them. Each <i>Cornea</i> seemed to have its <i>Iris</i>, (or
  Rain-bow-like Circle) and Apertures or Pupils distinct; and upon opening
  the <i>Cornea</i>, there was found within it two <i>Balls</i>, or
  <i>Crystalline Humours</i>, very well shaped; but the other parts of it
  could not be so well distinguished, because the eye had been much bruised
  by the handling, and the inner parts confused and dislocated. It had four
  Eye-browes, placed in the manner exprest in Figure 4. by <i>a a</i>, <i>b
  b</i>; <i>a a</i> representing the <i>lower</i>, and <i>b b</i>, the
  <i>upper</i> Eye-lids.</p>

  <p><i>Lastly</i>, That just above the Eyes, as it were in the midst of
  the Forehead, was a very deep depression, and out of the midst of that
  grew a kind of double <i>Purse</i> or <i>Bagg</i>, C C, containing little
  or nothing in it; but to some it seemed to be a production of the matter
  designed for the Nose, but diverted by this Monstrous Conception; perhaps
  the <i>Processus mammillares</i> joyned into one, and covered with a thin
  hairy skin.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<h3><i>Observables in the Body of the </i>Earl<i> of
</i>Balcarres<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>These following Observations, were a while since sent out of
  <i>Scotland</i> by an ingenious person, an Eye-witness, to Sir <i>Robert
  Moray</i>.</p>

  <p>1. That the Belly of this Nobleman being opened, the <i>Omentum</i> or
  <i>Net</i> was found lean and small: his <i>Liver</i> very big; the
  <i>Spleen</i> big also, filled with a black and thick humour. His
  <i>Stomack</i> and <i>Entralls</i> all empty, of a Saffron-colour,
  distended with wind only. The <i>Bladder</i> of <i>Gall</i> swelled with
  a black humour: The <i>Kidneys</i> filled with a kind of <i>grumous
  blood</i>.</p>

  <p>2. That in the <i>Thorax</i> or <i>Chest</i>, the <i>Lobes</i> of the
  <i>Lungs</i> were all entire, but of a bad colour; on the left side
  somewhat black and blue, and on the right, whitish; with a yellowish knob
  under one of the <i>Lobes</i>. <!-- Page 87 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page87"></a>{87}</span></p>

  <p>3. That the <i>Pericardium</i> or the <i>Case</i> of the <i>Heart</i>
  being opened, there appeared none of that water, in which the
  <i>Heart</i> uses to swim; and the external Surface of it, from the
  <i>Base</i> to the <i>Tipp</i>, was not smooth, but very rough. It being
  cut asunder, a quantity of white and inspissate liquour run out, and
  beneath the <i>Base</i>, between the right and left Ventricle, <i>two
  stones</i> were found, whereof the one was as bigg as an <i>Almond</i>,
  the other, <i>two</i> Inches long and <i>one</i> broad, having three
  <i>Auricles</i> or crisped <i>Angles</i>: And in the Orifice of the right
  Ventricle, there was a fleshy fattish Matter.</p>

  <p>4. That the whole Body was bloudless, thin, and emaciated, of a black
  and bluish Colour.</p>

  <p>5. The <i>Scull</i> being opened, both the <i>Cerebrum</i> and
  <i>Cerebellum</i> were bigg in proportion to the Body; and out of it run
  much more Bloud, than was seen in both the other Regions together.</p>

<h3><i>Of the designed Progress to be made in the
</i>Breeding of Silkworms<i>, and the </i>Making<i> of
</i>Silk<i>, in </i>France<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>The <i>French</i> King <i>Henry the Fourth</i>, having made a general
  Establishment all over <i>France</i>, of planting and propagating of
  <i>Mulberry-trees</i>, and <i>Breeding of Silkworms</i>, in order to set
  up and entertain a <i>Silk-trade</i> there; and having prospered so well
  in that Design, that in many parts of his Dominions great store of such
  Trees were raised, and Multitudes of Silk-works propagated, to the great
  benefit of the <i>French</i> people, forasmuch as it was a considerable
  beginning to avoid the transport of several Millions abroad for buying of
  Silks, and withall an excellent means of well-imploying abundance of poor
  Orphans and Widows, and many old, lame, and other indigent and helpless
  people; The present <i>French King</i>, hath lately revived and seconded
  that Undertaking by giving express order that it should be promoted by
  all possible means, and particularly in the <i>Metropolis</i> of that
  Kingdom, and round about it; and that for that end the whole way
  concerning that Work and <!-- Page 88 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page88"></a>{88}</span>Trade should be fully and punctually
  communicated in Print; which hath also been executed by one <i>Monsieur
  Isnard</i>, in a Treatise published at <i>Paris</i>, in <i>French</i>,
  Intituled, <i>Instructions for the Planting of White Mulberryes, the
  Breeding of Silkworms, and the Ordering of Silk in </i>Paris<i>, and the
  circumjacent Places</i>, In which Book, the Method being represented,
  which that Great Prince <i>Henry</i> IV used in establishing the said
  Work and Trade, together with the success thereof, and the advantages
  thence derived to his Subjects, the <i>Author</i>, from his own
  <i>Experience</i>, and long <i>Practice</i>, delivers (and seems to do it
  candidly) all what belongs in this business in four main heads.
  <i>First</i>, he teaches the Means of sowing, planting, and raising
  <i>White Mulberryes</i> (as the Foundation of Silkworks) shewing how many
  several wayes <i>that</i> may be done. <i>Secondly</i>, The Breeding of
  <i>Silkworms</i>, the choosing of good Eggs, and their hatching, as also
  the Feeding of the <i>Worms</i>, and preserving them from sickness, and
  Curing them of it, together with the way of making them spin to best
  advantage. <i>Thirdly</i>, The manner of winding their Silk from their
  Bottoms, adding the <i>Scheme</i> of the <i>Instrument</i> serving for
  that purpose. <i>Fourthly</i>, The way of <i>keeping</i> <i>Silkworms</i>
  Eggs for the ensuing year.</p>

  <p>Through the whole Book are scattered many not inconsiderable
  particulars, though perhaps known to most. The <i>White Mulberry
  Tree</i>, as it is in other qualities preferable to the <i>Black</i>, so
  this <i>Author</i> esteems it the best, not only for the durableness of
  the wood, and its large extent of usefulness in Carpentry and Joyners
  work; but also for the fitness of its leaves (besides their principal use
  for the food of <i>Silkworms</i>) to fatten Sheep, Goats, Cowes, and
  Hoggs, only by boyling and mingling them with Bran. The Berryes
  themselves he commends as very excellent to fatten Poultry, and to make
  them lay Eggs plentifully. In the <i>Changes</i>, <i>Working</i>, and
  <i>Generation</i> of this <i>Insect</i>, he is very curious to observe
  many things. Their <i>Metamorphoses</i>, as is known, are four, whereof
  the form of the one hath no conformity with any of the rest. The first
  from an Egge (of the bigness of a Mustard-seed, and of a darkish Gray
  Colour, when good) to a <i>Worm</i> or <i>Caterpillar</i>, but of a
  domestick, noble, and profitable kind, <i>Black</i>, when it first comes
  <!-- Page 89 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page89"></a>{89}</span>forth, but growing <i>white</i> at last;
  having 24. feet, 8. on each side of the body, and 4. besides, close to
  each side of the head. During this form, they undergo constantly 4.
  Sicknesses, in which they cast their Skins, each sickness lasting about
  4. days, wherein they feed not at all; but grow clearer, shorter, and
  thicker. The second from a <i>Worm</i> to an <i>Aurelia</i> or
  <i>Chrysalis</i>, having the shape of a small Plum, whereunto it is
  transformed after its spinning time is past; in which state it lies shut
  up, in hot Countries, for 14. or 15. dayes; in more temperate ones, 18.
  or 20. without any Food or Air, known to us. During which time this
  <i>Insect</i> leaves two Coats, both that of a <i>Worm</i>, whence 'tis
  changed into an <i>Aurelia</i>, and that of an <i>Aurelia</i>, whence it
  becomes a <i>Papilio</i> or <i>Butterfly</i>, in the <i>Theca</i> or
  <i>Case</i>. The third is, from an <i>Aurelia</i> to a <i>Butterfly</i>,
  coming out of the <i>Theca</i> with a head, leggs, and horns; for which
  passage it makes way by a whitish water, it casts upon the Silk, which
  moistning, and thereby in a manner putrefying it, the new creature
  thrusts out its head through the sharp end of the <i>Case</i>, by a Hole
  as big as its self. There is found no Excrement in the <i>Case</i>, but
  the two Skins only, just now mentioned.</p>

  <p>Before they begin to spin, and about the latter end of their feeding,
  they must, saith the <i>Author</i>, be often changed, and have Air
  enough, by opening the Windows of the Room, they are in, if it be not too
  ill Weather; else, saith he, the Silk that is in their Belly, will cause
  so extraordinary a heat in them, that it burns their gutts, and sometimes
  bursts them; and the same (being a substance that resembleth Gum or
  Burgundy Pitch) will putrefy and turn into a yellowish matter.</p>

  <p>He maketh the best marks of their maturity for spinning to be, when
  they begin to quit their white Colour, &amp; their green and yellow
  Circles, and grow of the Colour of Flesh, especially upon the tail;
  having a kind of <i>consistent</i> softness shewing that they have
  something substantial in their Stomachs.</p>

  <p>As for their <i>Working</i>, he gives this account of it, that the
  first day they make only a <i>Webb</i>; the second, they form in this
  <i>Webb</i> their <i>Cases</i>, and cover themselves all over with Silk;
  the third day, they are no longer seen, and the dayes following they
  thicken their <i>Cases</i>, alwayes by one <i>end</i> or <i>thread</i>,
  which they <!-- Page 90 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page90"></a>{90}</span>never break off, themselves. This, he
  affirms, they put out with so much quickness, and draw it so subtle and
  so long, that without an <i>Hyperbole</i>, the <i>end</i> or
  <i>thread</i> of every <i>Case</i> may have two Leagues in length. He
  advertiseth, that they must be by no means interrupted in their work, to
  the end, that all the Silk, they have in their bellyes, may come out.</p>

  <p>Some eight dayes after they have finished their Work, as many of the
  best <i>Cases</i>, as are to serve for <i>seed</i>, <i>viz.</i> the first
  done the hardest, the reddest and best coloured, must be chosen, and put
  a-part; and all diligence is to be used to winde off the silk with as
  much speed, as may be, especially if the <i>Worms</i> have nimbly
  dispatched their work.</p>

  <p>Here he spends a good part of his Book, in giving very particular
  Instructions, concerning the way of winding off the silk, setting also
  down the form of the Oven and Instruments necessary for that work, which
  is the painfullest and nicest of all the rest.</p>

  <p>Touching their <i>Generation</i>, he prescribeth that there be chosen
  as many male as female <i>Cases</i> (which are discerned by this, that
  the males are more pointed at both ends of the <i>Cases</i>, and the
  females more obtuse on the ends, and bigger-bellyed) and that care be
  had, that no <i>Cases</i> be taken, but such wherein the <i>Worms</i> are
  heard rolling; which done, and they being come forth in the form of
  <i>Butterflies</i>, having four wings, six feet, two horns, and two very
  black eyes, and put in a convenient place, the males fluttering with
  their wings, will joyn and couple with the females, after that these have
  first purged themselves of a kind of reddish humour by the fundament: in
  which posture they are to be left from Morning (which is the ordinary
  time of their coming forth) till evening, and then the females are to be
  gently pulled away, whereupon they will lay their eggs, having first let
  fall by the Fundament another humour, esteemed to proceed from the seed
  of the males; but the males are then thrown away as useless. He
  advertiseth, that if they be coupled longer than 9. or 10. hours, (which
  they will be, and that sometimes for 24. hours together, if they be let
  alone) either the female will receive very great hurt by it, or much seed
  will remain in her belly. <!-- Page 91 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page91"></a>{91}</span></p>

  <p>The seed at first coming out is very white, but within a day it becoms
  greenish, then red, at last by little and little gray, which colour it
  retains alwaies, the most coloured of an obscure gray, being the best;
  those grains which never quit their whiteness, having no fecundity in
  them.</p>

  <p>Each female emits ordinarily some 300 grains, more or less, some of
  them not being able to render them all, and dying with them in their
  belly. One ounce of seed will require an hundred pair of <i>Cases</i>, of
  as many Males as Females.</p>

  <p>Care must be taken, that no Rats, Mice, Ants, or other Vermin, nor any
  Hens, or Birds, come near the Seed, they being very greedy to eat
  them.</p>

  <p>This is the substance of what is contained in this <i>French</i>
  Author, published at <i>Paris</i> on purpose to promote the <i>Making</i>
  of <i>Silk</i> there, as well as it is practised already in other parts
  of that Kingdom; which is represented here, to the end, that from this
  occasion the design, which the English Nation once did entertain of the
  <i>increasing of Mulberry trees</i>, and the <i>Breeding of
  Silk-worms</i>, for the <i>Making of Silk</i> within themselves, may be
  renewed, and <i>that</i> encouragement given by King <i>James</i> of
  Glorious memory for that purpose (witness that <i>Letter</i> which he
  directed to the Lords Lievtenants of the several shires of
  <i>England</i>) and seconded by his <i>Most Excellent Majesty</i>, that
  now is, be made use of, for the honour of <i>England</i> and
  <i>Virginia</i>, and the increase of wealth to the people thereof;
  especially since there is cause of hope, that a <i>double Silk
  harvest</i> may be made in <i>one</i> Summer in <i>Virginia</i>, without
  hindring in the least the <i>Tobacco</i>-Trade of that Countrey.</p>

<h3><i>Enquiries concerning </i>Agriculture<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>Whereas the <i>Royal Society</i>, in prosecuting the <i>Improvements
  of Natural knowledge</i>, have it in design, to collect <i>Histories of
  Nature and Arts</i>, and for that purpose have already, according to the
  several Inclinations and Studies of their Members, divided themselves
  into divers <i>Commitees</i>, to execute the said design: Those
  Gentlemen, which do constitute the <i>Commitee</i> for considering of
  <i>Agriculture</i>, and the <i>History</i> and <i>Improvement</i>
  thereof, have begun their work with drawing up certain <!-- Page 92
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page92"></a>{92}</span>Heads of
  <i>Enquiries</i>, to be distributed to persons <i>Experienced in
  Husbandry</i> all over <i>England</i>, <i>Scotland</i>, and
  <i>Ireland</i>, for the procuring a <i>faithful</i> and <i>solid</i>
  information of the <i>knowledge</i> and <i>practice</i> already obtained
  and used in these Kingdoms; whereby, besides the aid which by this means
  will be given to the general End of collecting the aforementioned
  <i>History</i>, every place will be advantaged by the helps, that are
  found in any, and occasion ministred to consider, what improvements may
  be further made in this whole matter. Now to the End, that those
  <i>Enquiries</i> may be the more universally known, and those who are
  skilful in Husbandry, publickly invited to impart their knowledge herein,
  for the <i>common</i> benefit of their Countrey, it hath been thought fit
  to publish the <i>effect</i> of them in Print, and withal to desire that
  what such persons shall think good from their own <i>Knowledge</i> and
  <i>Experience</i> to communicate hereupon, they would be pleased to send
  it to the Printers of the <i>Royal Society</i>, to be delivered to either
  of the <i>Secretaries</i> of same. The Enquiries follow.</p>

<h3>1. For <i>Arable</i>.</h3>

  <p>1. The several kinds of the soyls of <i>England</i>, being supposed to
  be, either Sandy, Gravelly, Stony, Clayie, Chalky, Light mould, Heathy,
  Marish, Boggy, Fenny, or Cold weeping Ground; information is desired,
  what kind of soyls your Country doth most abound with, and how each of
  them is prepared, when employed for <i>Arable</i>?</p>

  <p>2. What <i>peculiar</i> preparations are made use of to these Soyls
  for each kind of Grain; with what kind of Manure they are prepared; when,
  how, &amp; in what quantity the Manure is laid on?</p>

  <p>3. At what seasons and how often they are ploughed; what kind of
  Ploughs are used for several sorts of Ground?</p>

  <p>4. How long the several Grounds are let lie fallow?</p>

  <p>5. How, and for what productions, <i>Heathy</i> Grounds may be
  improved? And who they are (if there be any in your Country) that have
  reduced <i>Heaths</i> into profitable Lands?</p>

  <p>6. What ground <i>Marle</i> hath over head? How deep generally it
  lieth from the surface? What is the depth of the <i>Marle</i> it self?
  What the colour of it? Upon what grounds it is used? <!-- Page 93
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page93"></a>{93}</span>What time of the
  year it is to be laid on? How many loads to an Acre? What Grains
  <i>Marled</i> Land will bear, and how many years together? How such
  <i>Marled</i> Land is to be used afterwards, <i>&amp;c</i>?</p>

  <p>7. The kinds of Grain or Seed, usual in <i>England</i>, being supposed
  to be either Wheat, Miscelane, Rye, Barley, Oats, Pease, Beans, Fitches,
  Buck-wheat, Hemp, Flax, Rape; We desire to know, what sorts of Grains are
  sown in your Country, and how each of these is prepared for Sowing?
  Whether by <i>steeping</i>, and in what kind of Liquor? Or by mixing it,
  and with what?</p>

  <p>8. There being many sorts of Wheat, as the White or Red Lammas, the
  bearded Kentish Wheat, the gray Wheat, the red or gray Pollard, the
  Ducks-bill Wheat, the red-eared-bearded Wheat, <i>&amp;c.</i> And so of

<h3><i>An Account of a not ordinary </i>Burning Concave<i>,
lately made at </i>Lyons<i>, and compared with several
others made formerly.</i></h3>

  <p>An opportunity being presented to revive the publishing of these
  Papers, which for some Moneths hath been <!-- Page 96 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page96"></a>{96}</span>discontinued by reason of
  the great Mortality in <i>London</i>, where they were begun to be
  Printed; it hath been thought fit to embrace the same, and to make use
  thereof for the gratifying of the Curious, that have been pleased to
  think well of such Communications: To re-enter whereupon, there offers it
  self, first of all a Relation of an uncommon <i>Burning-glass</i>, not
  long since made in <i>France</i>, in the City of <i>Lyons</i>, by one
  called Monsieur <i>de Vilette</i>, as it was sent to the Publisher of
  these Tracts, in two Letters, whereof the one was in <i>Latine</i>, the
  other in French, to this effect.</p>

  <p>Concerning the Efficacy of Monsieur <i>de Villete</i> his Burning
  Glass, all what the <i>P. Bertet</i> hath written of it, is true. We have
  seen the effects of it repeated over and over again, in the Morning, at
  Noon, and in the Afternoon, alwaies performing very powerfully; burning
  or melting any Matter, very few excepted. The <i>Figure</i> of it is
  round, being thirty Inches, and somewhat better in <i>Diameter</i>. On
  one side it hath a Frame of a Circle of Steel, to the end that it may
  keep its just Measure: 'Tis easie to remove it from place to place,
  though it be above an hundred weight, and 'tis easily put in all sorts of
  postures. The <i>burning Point</i> is distant from the Centre of the
  Glass, about three Feet. The <i>Focus</i> is about half a <i>Louys
  d'or</i> large. One may pass ones hand through it, if it be done nimbly;
  for if it stay there the time of a second Minute, there is danger of
  receiving much hurt.</p>

  <p><i>Green wood</i> takes fire in it, in an instant, as do also many
  other Bodies.</p>

  <p>In short, there is hardly any Body, which is not destroyed by this
  Fire. If one would melt it by it any great quantity of Mettal, that would
  require much time, the Action of Burning not being perform'd but within
  the bigness of the <i>Focus</i>, so that ordinarily none but small pieces
  are exposed to it. One Mounsieur <i>de Alibert</i> buys it, paying for it
  Fifteen hundred Livers.</p>

  <p>Since this Information, there were, upon occasion given from thence,
  upon the same subject, further communicated from <i>Paris</i> the
  following Particulars.</p>

  <p>I see by two of the Letters, that you incline to believe, the Glasses
  of <i>Maginus</i> and <i>Septalius</i> do approach to that of
  <i>Lyons</i>: But I can assure you, they come very far short of it. You
  may consult <i>Maginus</i> his Book, where he describes his; and there
  are some persons here that have seen one of his best, which had but about
  twenty Inches Diameter; so that this of <i>Lyons</i> must perform at
  least twice as much. As to <i>Septalius</i>, we expect the Relations of
  it from Intelligent and Impartial men. It cannot well be compared to that
  of <i>Lyons</i>: but in bigness; and in this case, if it have five
  <i>Palms</i> (as you say) that would be about 3½ feet <i>French</i>, and
  so it were a Foot bigger, which would make it half as much greater in
  surface: But as to the Effects, seeing it burns so far off, they cannot
  be very violent. And I have heard one say, that had seen it, that it did
  not set Wood on Fire but after the time of saying a <i>Miserere</i>. You
  may judge of the difference of the Effects, since that of <i>Lyons</i>
  gathers its Beams together within the space of seven or eight
  <i>Lines</i>; <!-- Page 98 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page98"></a>{98}</span>and that of <i>Septalius</i> must scatter
  them in the compass of three Inches. Some here do intend to make of them
  yea and bigger ones; but we must stay till they be done,
  <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<h3>Of <i>Monsieur </i>Hevelius<i>'s Promise of imparting to
the World his Invention of making </i>Optick
Glasses<i>; and of the hopes given by Monsieur
</i>Hugens<i> of </i>Zulichem<i>, to perform something of
the like nature; as also of the Expectations,
conceived of some Ingenious Persons in </i>England<i>
to improve</i> Telescopes.</h3>

  <p>That eminent Astronomer of <i>Dantzick</i>, Monsieur <i>Hevelius</i>,
  writes to his Correspondent in <i>London</i>, as followeth:</p>

  <p>What hath been done in the grinding of Optick-glasses in your parts,
  and how those beginnings, mentioned by you formerly, do continue and
  succeed, I very much covet to hear, 'Tis now above Ten Years, since I my
  self invented a peculiar way of grinding such Glasses, and reduced it
  also into practice; by which 'tis easie, without any considerable danger
  of failing, to make and polish Optick-glasses of any <i>Conick</i>
  Section, and that (which is most notable) in any dish of any Section of a
  <i>Sphere</i>: which Invention I have as yet discovered to none, my
  purpose being, for the Improvement of Natural Knowledge, to describe the
  whole method thereof in my <i>Celestial Machine</i>, and to propose it to
  the Examination and Judgment of the <i>Royal Society</i>; not doubting at
  all, but they will find the way true and practicable, my self having
  already made several Glasses by it, which many Learned Men have seen and
  tryed.</p>

  <p>Monsieur <i>Hugens</i>, inquiring also in a Letter, newly written by
  him to a Friend of his in <i>England</i>, of the success of the attempts
  made by an ingenious <i>English</i> Man for perfecting such Glasses, and
  urging the prosecution of the same, <!-- Page 99 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page99"></a>{99}</span>so as to shew by the
  effects the practicableness of the Invention, mentions thereupon, That he
  intends very shortly to try something in that kind, of the success
  whereof he declares to have good hopes.</p>

  <p>Monsieur <i>du Son</i>, that excellent Mechanician, doth also at this
  very present employ himself in <i>London</i>, to bring <i>Telescopes</i>
  to perfection, by grinding Glasses of a <i>Parabolical</i> Figure, by the
  means whereof he hopes to enable the Curious to discover more by a Tube
  of one Foot long, or thereabouts, furnished with Glasses thus figured,
  then can be done by any other Tubes of very many times more that length:
  The success hereof will ('tis thought) shortly appear.</p>

<h3><i>An Advertisement of a way of making more lively
Counterfeits of Nature in </i>Wax<i>, then are extant
in </i>Painting<i>: And of a new kind of </i>Maps<i>
in a low </i>Relievo<i>. Both practised in</i> France.</h3>

  <p>This was communicated by the Ingenious Mr. <i>John Evelyn</i>, to whom
  it was sent from <i>Paris</i> is a Letter, as followeth.</p>

  <p>Here is in our Neighbourhood a <i>French-man</i>, who makes more
  lively Counterfeits of Nature in <i>Wax</i>, then ever I yet saw in
  <i>Painting</i>, haveing an extraordinary address in modelling the
  Figures, and mixing the Colours and Shadows; making the Eyes so lively,
  that they kill all things of this Art I ever beheld; He pretends to make
  a visit into <i>England</i> with some of his Peices.</p>

  <p>I have also seen a new kind of <i>Maps</i> in low <i>Relievo</i>, or
  Sculpture; For example the Isle of <i>Antibe</i>, upon a square of about
  eight Foot, made of Boards, with a Frame like a Picture: There is
  represented the Sea, with Ships and other Vessels Artificially made, with
  their <i>Canons</i> and Tackle of Wood fixed upon the surface, after a
  new and most admirable manner. The Rocks about the Island exactly form'd,
  <!-- Page 100 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page100"></a>{100}</span>as they are upon the Natural Place; and
  the Island it self, with all its Inequalities, and Hills and Dales; the
  Town, the Forts, the little Houses, Platform, and Canons mounted; and
  even the Gardens and Platforms of Trees, with their green leaves standing
  upright, at if they were growing in their Natural Colours: in
  <i>fine</i>, Men, Beasts, and whatever you may imagine to have any
  protuberancy above the level of the Sea. This new, delightful, and most
  instructive form of <i>Map</i>, or <i>Wooden Country</i>, you are to look
  upon either <i>Horizontally</i>, or <i>side-long</i>, and it affords
  equally a very pleasant object.</p>

<h3><i>Some </i>Anatomical<i> Observations of Milk found in
Veins, instead of Blood; and of Grass, found
in the Wind-pipes of some </i>Animals<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>A curious Person wrote not long since from <i>Paris</i>, that there
  they had, in the house of a Physitian, newly open'd a Mans Vein, wherein
  they found <i>Milk</i>, instead of <i>Blood</i>. This being imparted to
  Mr. <i>Boyle</i> at <i>Oxford</i>, his Answer was, That the like
  Observation about <i>White Blood</i>, had been made by a Learned
  Physitian of his acquaintance, and the thing being by him look'd upon as
  remarkable, he was desirous to have it very circumstantially from the
  said Physitian himself, before he would say more of it. The next Moneth
  may bring us in this Account.</p>

  <p>The other Particular, mention'd in the Title of this Head, came in a
  Letter sent also by Mr. <i>Boyle</i>, in these words:</p>

  <p>I shall acquaint you, That Two very Ingenious Men, Dr. <i>Clark</i>,
  and Dr. <i>Lower</i>, were pleased to give me an account of a pretty odd
  kind of Observation: One of them assuring me, That he had several times,
  in the <i>Lungs</i> of <i>Sheep</i>, found considerable quantity of Grass
  in the very Branches of the <i>Aspera Arteria</i>: And the other relating
  to me, That a few Weeks since, he, and a couple of <!-- Page 101 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page101"></a>{101}</span>Physitians, were
  invited to look upon an Ox, that had for two or three daies almost
  continually held his Neck streight up, and was dead of a Disease, the
  owner could not conjecture at; whereupon the parts belonging to the Neck
  and Throat, being open'd, they found, to their wounder, the <i>Aspera
  Arteria</i> in its very Trunk all stuff'd with Grass as if it had been
  thrust there by main force: which gives us a just cause of marvelling and
  inquiring, both how such a quantity of Grass should get in there; and
  how, being there, such an Animal could live with it so long.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<h3><i>Of a place in </i>England<i>, where, without petrifying
Water, Wood is turned into Stone.</i></h3>

  <p>The same Searcher of Nature, that was alledged in the immediately
  precedent Observations, did impart also the following, in another Letter
  from <i>Oxford</i>, where he saith,</p>

  <p>I was a while since visited by a Gentleman, who tells me, That he met
  with a place in these parts of <i>England</i>, where, though there be no
  petrifying Spring (for that I particularly asked) Wood is turned into
  Stone in the <i>Sandy Earth</i> it self, after a better manner then by
  any Water I have yet seen: For I had the Curiosity to go to look upon
  peices of Wood, he brought thence, and hope for the opportunity of making
  some tryals to examine the matter a little further, then I have yet been
  able to do. <i>Thus far that Letter.</i></p>

  <p>Since which time, He was pleased to give this further Information of
  the same matter, with a <i>Mantissa</i> of some other Particulars,
  belonging to this Subject, in these Words.</p>

  <p>I was lately making some Tryals with the Petrifyed Wood I told you
  off, which I find to be a very odde substance, wonderfully hard and
  fixed. If I had opportunity to Re-print the <i>History of Fluidity</i>
  and <i>Firmness</i>, I could add divers things about <i>Stones</i>, that
  perhaps would not be disliked; and I hope, if God vouchsafe me a little
  leisure, <!-- Page 102 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page102"></a>{102}</span>to insert several of them in fit places of
  that <i>History</i>, against the next Edition. Here is a certain Stone,
  that is thought to be Petrifyed Bone, being in shap'd like a Bone, with
  the Marrow taken out; but with a fit <i>Menstruum</i>, I found that I
  could easily dissolve it, like other soft Stones: and possibly it may
  prove as fit as <i>Osteocolla</i>, for the same Medicinal uses.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<h3><i>Of the nature of a certain Stone, found in the </i>Indies<i>,
in the head of a </i>Serpent<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>There was, some while ago, sent by Sir <i>Philiberto Vernatti</i>,
  from <i>Java major</i>, where he resides, to Sir <i>Robert Moray</i>, for
  the Repository of the <i>Royal Society</i>, a certain Stone, affirmed by
  the presenter to be found in the Head of a <i>Snake</i>, which laid upon
  any Wound, made by any venomous Creature, is said to stick to it, and to
  draw away all Poyson: and then, being put in Milk, to void its Poyson
  therein, and to make the Milk turn blew; in which manner it must be used,
  till the Wound be cleansed.</p>

  <p>The like Relations having been made, by several others, of such a
  Stone, and some also in this City affirming, to have made the Experiment
  with success, it was thought worth while, to inquire further into the
  truth of this Matter: since which time, nothing hath been met with but an
  Information, delivered by that Ingenious <i>Parisian</i>, Monsieur
  <i>Thevenot</i>, in his second <i>Tome</i>, of the <i>Relations of divers
  considerable Voyages</i>, whereof he lately presented some Exemplars to
  his Friends in <i>England</i>. The Book being in French, and not common,
  'tis conceived it will not be amiss to insert here the said Information,
  which is to this effect:</p>

  <p>In the <i>East Indies</i> and in the Kingdom of <i>Quamsy</i> in
  <i>China</i>, there is found a Stone in the Head of a certain
  <i>Serpent</i> (which they call by a name signifying <i>Hairy
  Serpents</i>) which heals the bitings of the same Serpent, that else
  would kill in 24 hours. This Stone is round, white in the middle and
  about the <!-- Page 103 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page103"></a>{103}</span>edges blew or greenish. Being applyed to
  the Wound, it adheres to it of it self, and falls not off, but after it
  hath sucked the Poyson, then they wash it in Milk, wherein 'tis left
  awhile, till it return to its natural condition. It is a rare Stone, for
  if it be put the second time upon the Wound, and stick to it, 'tis a sign
  it had not suck'd all the Venome during its first application, but if it
  stick not, 'tis a mark that all the Poyson was drawn out at first. So far
  our <i>French</i> Author: wherein appears no considerable difference from
  the written Relation before mentioned.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<h3><i>Of the way, used in the </i>Mogol<i>'s Dominions, to
make </i>Saltpetre<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>This is delivered in the same Book of Monsieur <i>Thevenot</i>, and
  the manner of it having been inquired after, by several curious Persons,
  to compare it with that which is used in <i>Europe</i>, 'tis presum'd,
  they will not be displeased to find it inserted here in <i>English</i>,
  which is as followeth:</p>

  <p><i>Saltpetre</i> is found in many places of the <i>East-Indies</i>,
  but cheifly about <i>Agra</i>, and in the Villages, that heretofore have
  been numerously inhabited, but are now deserted. They draw it out of
  three sorts of Earth, black, yellow, and white: the best is that which is
  drawn out of the black, for it is free from <i>common</i> Salt. They work
  it in this manner: They make two Pits, flat at the bottom, like those
  wherein common Salt is made; one of them having much more compass than
  the other, they fill <i>that</i> with Earth, upon which they let run
  Water, and by the feet of People they <span class="correction"
  title="Original reads `traed'.">tread</span> it, and reduce it to the
  consistency of a Pap, and so they let it stand for two daies, that the
  Water may extract all the Salt that is in the Earth: Then they pass this
  Water into another Pit, in which it christallizes into <i>Saltpetre</i>,
  They let it boil once or twice in a Caldron, according as they will have
  it whiter and purer. Whilest it is over the Fire, they scum it
  continually, and fill it out into great Earthen Pots, which <!-- Page 104
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page104"></a>{104}</span>hold each 25
  or 30 pounds, and these they expose to clear Nights; and if there be any
  impurity remaining, it will fall to the bottom: Afterwards they break the
  Pots, and dry the Salt in the Sun. One might make vast quantities of
  Saltpetre in these parts; but the Country people feeling that <i>We</i>
  buy of it, and that the <i>English</i> begin to do the same, they now
  sell us a <span class="correction" title="Original reads `Moan'."
  ><i>Maon</i></span> of 6 pounds for two <i>Rupias</i> and a half, which
  we had formerly for half that price.</p>

<h3><i>An account of </i>Hevelius<i> his </i>Prodromus Cometicus<i>,
together with some Animadversions made upon
it by a </i>French<i> Philosopher.</i></h3>

  <p>This excellent <i>Dantiscan</i> Astronomer, <i>Hevelius</i>, in his
  <i>Prodromus</i> (by him so call'd, because it is as a Harbinger to his
  <i>Cometography</i>, which hath already so far passed the Press, that of
  twelve Books there are but three remaining to be Printed) gives an
  account of the Observations he hath made of the <i>First</i> of the two
  late Comets; reserving those he hath made of the <i>second</i>, for that
  great Treatise, where he also intends to deliver the Matter of this
  <i>first</i> more particularly, and more fully than he hath done
  here.</p>

  <p>In this Account he represents the Rise, Place, Course, Swiftness,
  Faces and Train of this Comet, interweaving his Conceptions both about
  the Region of Comets in general (whether in the <i>Air</i>, or the
  <i>Æther</i>?) and the Causes of their Generation: In the search of which
  latter, he intimates to have received much assistance from his
  <i>Telescope</i>.</p>

  <p>He observes this Comet not before <i>Decemb.</i>
  <sup>4</sup>/<sub>14</sub>, (though he conceives it might have been seen
  since <i>Novemb.</i> 23 <i>st. n.</i>) &amp; he saw it no longer then
  <i>Feb.</i> <sup>3</sup>/<sub>13</sub>: though several others have seen
  it both sooner, and later: and though himself continued to look out for
  it till <i>March</i> 7. <i>st. n.</i> but fruitlesly, whereof he thinks
  the reason to have been its too great distance and tenuity.</p>

<p><!-- Page 105 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page105"></a>{105}</span></p>

  <p>He finds, its apparent Motion was not made in a <i>Just</i> great
  Circle, but deviated considerably from it; and conceives, that every
  Comet falls to this deviation, when this apparent Motion grows slow, and
  the Star becomes Stationary (which, as he saith, it doth in respect of
  the <i>Ecliptick</i>, not its own <i>Orbite</i>,) Here he observes, That
  from <i>Decemb.</i> <sup>8</sup>/<sub>18</sub>, to <i>Decem.</i> 30.
  <i>Jan.</i> 9. its course was almost a great Circle: but that <i>then</i>
  it began to deflect from that Circle towards the <i>North</i>; so that
  afterwards, with a very notable and conspicuous Curvity, it directed its
  course towards <i>Primam Arietis</i>: Of which deflection, he ventures to
  assign the cause from the Cometical Matter, the various position and the
  distance of the Comet from the Earth and the Sun, the annual Motion of
  the Earth, and the impressed Motion, and the inclination of the
  <i>discus</i> of the Cometical Body.</p>

  <p>He is pretty positive, that without the <i>annual Motion</i> of the
  <i>Earth</i>, no rational Account can be given of any Comet, but that all
  is involved with perplexities, and deform'd by absurdities.</p>

  <p>He inquires, since all Comets have the peculiar <i>Ingenite</i>
  Motion, what kind of Line it is, they describe by that Motion of their
  own? whether circular, or streight, or curve, or partly streight and
  partly curve? And if curve, whether regular or irregular? if regular,
  whether Elliptick, or Parabolar, or Hyperbolical? He answers, That this
  Motion is <i>Conical</i>; and judgeth, that by the <i>Conick</i> path all
  the <i>Phænomena</i> of Comets can, without any inconveniency, be ready
  solved; even of that, which (by History) in fifty daies, passed through
  more then the 12 Signs in the <i>Zodiack</i>: And of that, which in two
  daies ran through eight Signs: and of another, which in 48 daies posted
  through all the Signs, <i>contra seriem</i>. Which how it can be
  explicated upon the supposition of the Earths standing still, and upon
  the denying of the annual Motion thereof, he understands not at all. <!--
  Page 106 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page106"></a>{106}</span></p>

  <p>He refers to his <i>Cometography</i> these Disquisitions: whether all
  Comets (in their innate Motion) move equal <i>spaces</i> in equal
  <i>Times</i>? which is the swiftest, and which the slowest Motion they
  are capable of? what the cause of this acceleration and retardation of
  their true Motion?</p>

  <p>He puts it out of doubt, that they are in the <i>Sky</i> it self,
  producing reasons for it that are very considerable, and alledging
  amongst others, That the <i>Parallaxes</i> doe clearly evince it, which
  he finds far less in Comets, then in the <i>Moon</i>, yea then sometimes
  in the <i>Sun</i> it self. Where he also represents, That he hath deduced
  the <i>Horizontal Parallax</i> of this very Comet from one onely
  Observation, made <i>Feb.</i> 4. <i>st. n.</i> by which he found, That
  then it was distant from the Earth 5000 Semidiameters of the same, or
  4300000 <i>German</i> miles. From this distance from the earth, he
  deduces, That on that Day when it was so remote from the Earth, its true
  <i>Diameter</i> was 2560 <i>German</i> miles, which is three times bigger
  then the Diameter of the Earth, and almost six times bigger then that of
  the Moon, whose Diameter, according to his <i>Theory</i>, is 442
  <i>German</i> miles.</p>

  <p>He finds the <i>Matter</i> of Comets to be in the <i>Æther</i> it
  self, making the <i>Æther</i> and the <i>Air</i> to differ only in
  purity, and esteeming, That the <i>Planets</i> do emit their Exhalations,
  and have their <i>Atmospheres</i> like unto our Earth. Where he affirms,
  That the Sun alone may cast out so much Matter at any time in one year,
  as that thence shall be produced not one or two Comets, equallizing the
  Moon in Diamiter, but very many; which if so, what contribution may not
  be expected from the other Planets?</p>

  <p>Of this Cometical Matter, he thinks, That first it is by little and
  little gathered together, then coagulated and condensed, and thereby
  reduced to a less Diameter; but then, after a while it resolves again,
  and grows dilute and pale, and at last is dissipated. And accordingly he
  affirms, That he hath observed the Head of this Comet at first more
  confused, thin and pale, afterwards clearer and clearer. <!-- Page 107
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page107"></a>{107}</span></p>

  <p>He conceives, That all Comets do respect the <i>Sun</i> as their
  <i>King</i> and <i>Centre</i>, as <i>Planets</i> do, making them a kind
  of <i>Spurious Planets</i>, that emulate the <i>true</i> ones in their
  Motion almost in all things.</p>

  <p>The <i>Train</i>, he makes nothing else but the Beams of the Sun,
  falling on the head of the Comet, and passing through the same, refracted
  and reflected. And amongst his <i>Observations</i> and <i>Schemes</i> of
  this Comet, there occurs one, wherein the Tail is <i>curve</i>, so seen
  by him <i>Decemb.</i> <sup>11</sup>/<sub>21</sub>. He assigns the causes
  why the Trains do so much vary, and shews also, on what depends their
  length.</p>

  <p>Whether the <i>same</i> Comet returns again, as the Spots in the Sun?
  and, whether in the time of great <i>Conjunctions</i> they are more
  easily generated? and whether they can be certainly foretold? with
  several other Inquiries, he refers for to his <i>great Book</i>.</p>

  <p>As to <i>Prognostications</i>, he somewhat complains, That men do more
  inquire what Comets <i>signifie</i>, then what they <i>are</i>, or how
  they are generated and moved; professing himself to be of the mind of
  those that would have Comets rather <i>admired</i> then <i>feared</i>;
  there appearing indeed no cogent reason, why the Author of Nature may not
  intend them rather as Monitors of his <i>Glory</i> and <i>Greatness</i>,
  then of his <i>Anger</i> or <i>Displeasure</i>; especially seeing that
  some very diligent Men (among whom is <i>Gemma Frisius</i>) take notice
  of as great a number of <i>good</i> as <i>bad</i> Events, consequent to
  Comets. <i>Seneca</i> also relating, That that Comet which appeared in
  his time, was so happy, that it did <i>Cometis detrahere infamiam</i>, it
  cleared the credit of Comets, and made People have good thoughts of
  them.</p>

  <p>Having given some Account of what may be look'd for in this
  <i>Prodromus</i>, it follows, That some also should be rendred of the
  <i>Animadversions</i> mention'd to have been made upon the same. This was
  done by that <i>Parisian</i> Philosopher Monsieur <i>Auzout</i>, in a
  Letter of his to his Country-man Monsieur <i>Petit</i>; in which he
  strongly conceives, That this <!-- Page 108 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page108"></a>{108}</span><i>Prodromus</i> contains some mistakes,
  of which he chiefly singles out one, as most considerable, in
  <i>Hevelius</i>'s Observation of <i>Feb.</i> <sup>8</sup>/<sub>18</sub>,
  and declares thereupon, That he, and several very intilligent Astronomers
  of <i>France</i> and <i>Italy</i> concurring with him therein, (whereas
  M. <i>Hevelius</i> to him seems to stand single, as to this particular)
  found by their Observations, That this Comet could not, on that day of
  <i>February</i>, be there where M. <i>Hevelius</i> placeth it,
  <i>viz.</i> In <i>Prima Arietis</i>; unless it be said, That it visited
  that Star of <i>Aries</i> on the 18, and returned thence the
  19<sup>th</sup>, into its ordinary course; in which, according to his,
  and his several Correspondents Observations the Comet on <i>Feb.</i> 17.
  was distant from that <i>first Star</i> of <i>Aries</i> at least 1 degree
  and 17 minutes; and on <i>February</i> 19. (he having missed, as well as
  his other Friends, the Observation on <i>Febr.</i> 18) was advanced in
  its way 12 or 13 minutes, but yet distant from the said Star <i>some
  minutes</i> above a <i>whole degree</i>, and consequently far from having
  then passed it. After which time M. <i>Auzout</i> affirms to have seen it
  as well as several others, for many daies, and that until <i>March</i>
  <sup>7</sup>/<sub>17</sub>, observing, That about <i>Feb.</i> 26. or 27,
  when the Comet was nearest to the often-mentioned <i>first</i> of
  <i>Aries</i>, it approached not nearer thereunto, then the distance of
  50. minutes.</p>

  <p>This important Difference between two very Learned, and very deserving
  Persons, being come to the knowledge of some of the ablest
  <i>Philosophers</i> &amp; <i>Astronomers</i> of <i>England</i>, hath been
  by them thought worthy their Examination: and they being at this very
  present employed in the discussion thereof, by comparing what hath been
  done and published by the Dissenters, and by confronting with them their
  own Domestick Observations, are very likely to discern where the mistake
  lies; and having discern'd it, will certainly be found hightly impartial
  and ingenuous in giving their sense of the same. <!-- Page 109 --><span

  <i>Hassia</i> into <i>Sicily</i> (in which Voyage, he saith, He met with,
  as it were, an <i>Epitome</i> of what may be observable in the
  Subterraneous parts of the Earth; and in particular, with an Earth-quake
  of 14 daies duration, very instructive to him concerning several great
  Secrets of Nature:) having I say, thus Prefaced, he divided his Work into
  12 <i>Books</i>, wherein he affirms not only to have explicated the
  Divine Structure of the under-ground World, and the wondrous distribution
  of the Work-houses of Nature, and her Majesty and Riches therein; but

  <i>Pole</i>; and several transverse <i>ductus</i>, so cutting that
  <i>Axis</i>, as to make, in a manner, an <i>Equator</i> and
  <i>Tropicks</i> of Mountains: by which concatenation he imagines, That
  the several parts of the Earth are bound together for more firmness,
  <i>p.</i> 69.</p>

  <p>A Relation of a strange <i>Diver</i>, by his continual converse in

  commerce, according to him, the Waters, when, upon their accumulation and
  crowding together in one of these places, they are swallowed up by the
  Gulf there, carrying along with them whatsoever is in the way and lodging
  it in a certain receptacle at the bottom thereof, are conveyed through
  the same under-ground Channel to the other Gulf; where again, upon the
  like flux and retumescence of Waters, they are absorbed, and through the

<h3><i>A farther account of an Observation above-mentioned,
about </i>White Blood<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>Since the Printing of the former Sheet, there is this farther account
  from the same hand.</p>

  <p>Mr. <i>Boyle</i>,</p>

  <p>I have at length, according to your desire, received from the
  Ingenious Dr. <i>Lower</i>, an account in writing of the Observation
  about <i>Chyle</i> found in the Blood; which though you may think
  strange, agrees well with some Experiments of his and mine, not now to be
  mentioned. The Relation, though short, comprizing the main Particulats of
  what he had more fully told me in Discourse, I shall give it you with
  little or no variation from his own words. <!-- Page 118 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page118"></a>{118}</span></p>

  <p>A Maid, after eating a good Break-fast, about seven in the Morning,
  was let Blood about eleven the same day in her Foot; the first Blood was
  receiv'd in a Porringer, and within a little while it turn'd very white;
  the last Blood was received in a Sawcer, which turn'd white immediately,
  like the white of a Custard. Within five or six hours after, he (the
  Physitian) chanced to see both, and that in the Porringer was half Blood
  and half Chyle, swimming upon it like a Serum as white as Milk, and that
  in the Sawcer all Chyle without the least appearance of a drop of Blood;
  and when he heated them distinctly over a gentle fire, they both
  harden'd: As the white of an Egge when 'tis heated, or just as the
  <i>Serum</i> of Blood doth with heating, but far more white. This Maid
  was then in good health, and only let Blood because she never had her
  Courses, yet of a very florid clear Complexion.</p>

  <i>Parabolical</i> Figure, the <i>Publisher</i> of these <i>Papers</i>

  &amp; a half deep, and one inch and a quarter broad, wrought by this
  Eminent <i>Artist</i> with a rare Steel-instrument of his own contrivance
  and workmanship, and by himself also polished to admiration. And
  certainly it will be wondred at by those, <!-- Page 120 --><span

  Glasses, how they could be truly wrought to such a Figure, with such a
  Cavity; &amp; yet more, when they shall hear the Author undertake to
  excavate other such <i>Eye-Glasses</i> to above two inches, and
  <i>Object-glasses</i> of five inches <i>Diameter</i>. He hath likewise
  already begun his <i>Object-glasses</i> for the mentioned two
  <i>Ocular</i> ones, of the same Figure of about two inches
  <i>Diameter</i>, which are to be left all open, yet without causing any
  colours. Of all which 'tis hoped, that shortly a fuller and more
  particular accompt will be given.</p>

<h3><i>Monsieur </i>Auzout's<i> Speculations of the Changes, likely
to be discovered in the </i>Earth<i> and </i>Moon<i>, by their
respective Inhabitants.</i></h3>

  <p>This Inquisitive <i>Philosopher</i> in a letter of his, lately written
  to his correspondent in <i>London</i>, takes occasion to discourse of his
  considerations concerning those Changes, mentioned in the <i>Title</i>,
  as followes;</p>

  <p>I have (saith he) sometimes thought upon the <i>Changes</i>, which
  'tis likely, the supposed Inhabitants of the <i>Moon</i> might discover
  in our <i>Earth</i>, to see, whither reciprocally I could observe any
  such in the <i>Moon</i>. For example, methinks, that the <i>Earth</i>
  would to the people of the <i>Moon</i> appear to have a different face in
  the several seasons of the year; and to have another appearance in
  <i>Winter</i>, when there is almost nothing green in a very great part of
  the <i>Earth</i>; when there are Countries all covered with snow, others,
  all covered with water, others, all obscured with Clouds, and that for
  many weeks together: <i>Another</i> in <i>Spring</i>, when the Forrests
  and Fields are green. <i>Another</i> in <i>Summer</i>, when whole Fields
  are yellow &amp;c. Me thinks, I say, that <i>these</i> changes are
  considerable enough in the force of the reflexions of Light to be
  observed, since we see so many differences of Lights in the <i>Moon</i>.
  We have <i>Rivers</i> considerable enough to be seen, and they enter far
  enough <!-- Page 121 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page121"></a>{121}</span>into the Land, and have a bredth capable
  to be observed. There are <i>Fluxes</i> in certain places, that reach
  into large Countries, enough to make there some apparent change; &amp; in
  some of our Seas there float sometimes such bulky masses of Ice, that are
  far greater, than the Objects, which we are assured, we can see in the
  <i>Moon</i>. Again, we cut down whole Forrests, and drain Marishes, of an
  extent large enough to cause a notable alteration: And men have made such
  works, as have produced Changes great enough to be perceived. In many
  places also are <i>Vulcans</i>, that seem big enough to be distinguish't,
  especially in the shadow: And when Fire lights upon Forrests of great
  extent, or upon Towns, it can hardly be doubted, but these Luminous
  Objects would appear either in an Ecclipse of the Earth, or when such
  parts of the Earth are not illuminated by the Sun. But yet, I know no
  man, who hath observed such things in the <i>Moon</i>; and one may be
  rationally assured that no <i>Vulcans</i> are there, <span
  class="correction" title="Original reads `or or' over two lines."
  >or</span> that none of them burn at this time. This it is (<i>so he goes
  on</i>) which all Curious men, that have good <i>Telescopes</i>, ought
  well to attend; and I doubt not; but, if we had a very particular
  <i>Map</i> of the <i>Moon</i>, as I had designed to make one with a
  <i>Topography</i>, as it were, of all the considerable places therein,
  that We or our Posterity would find some changes in Her. And if the
  <i>Mapps</i> of the <i>Moon</i> of <i>Hevelius</i>, <i>Divini</i>, and
  <i>Riccioli</i> are exact, I can say, that I have seen there some places
  considerable enough, where <i>they</i> put <i>parts that are clear</i>,
  whereas <i>I</i> there see <i>dark ones</i>. 'Tis true that if there be
  <i>Seas</i> in the <i>Moon</i>, it can hardly fall out otherwise, than it
  doth upon our <i>Earth</i>, where <i>Alluvium's</i> are made in some
  places, and the Sea gains upon the Land in others. <i>I say</i>, if those
  Spots we see in the <i>Moon</i>, are Seas, as most believe them to be;
  whereas I have many reasons, that make me doubt, whether they be so; of
  which I shall speak elsewhere. And I have sometimes thought, whether it
  might not be, that all the Seas of the <i>Moon</i>, if there must be
  Seas, were on the side of the other <i>Hemisphere</i>, and that for this
  cause it might be that the <i>Moon</i> turns not upon its <i>Axis</i>, as
  our <i>Earth</i>, <!-- Page 122 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page122"></a>{122}</span>wherein the Lands and Seas are, as it
  were, ballanced: That thence also may proceed the non-appearance of any
  Clouds raised there, or of any Vapors considerable enough to be seen, as
  there are raised upon this Earth; and that this absence of Vapors is
  perhaps the cause, that no <i>Crepuscle</i> is there, as it seems there
  is none, my selfe at least not having hitherto been able to discerne any
  mark thereof: For, me thinks, it is not to be doubted, but that the
  reputed Citizens of the <i>Moon</i> might see our <i>Crepuscle</i>, since
  we see, that the same is without comparison stronger, than the
  <i>Light</i> afforded us by the <i>Moon</i>, even when she is
  <i>full</i>; for, a little after Sun-set, when we receive no more than
  the <i>first</i> Light of the <i>Sun</i>, the sky is far clearer, than it
  is in the fairest night of the <i>full Moon</i>. Mean while, since we see
  in <i>the Moon</i>, when she is increasing or decreasing, the Light she
  receives from the Earth, we cannot doubt, but that the People of the
  <i>Moon</i> should likewise see in the <i>Earth</i> that Light, wherewith
  the <i>Moon</i> illuminates it, with perhaps the difference, there is
  betwixt their bigness. Much rather therefore should they see the Light of
  the <i>Crepuscle</i>, being, as we have said, incomparably greater. In
  the mean time we see not any faint Light beyond the <i>Section</i> of the
  Light, which is every where almost equaly strong, and we there
  distinguish nothing at all, not so much that cleerest part, which is
  called <i>Aristarchus</i>, or <i>Porphyrites</i>, as I have often tryed;
  although one may there see the Light, which the <i>Earth</i> sends
  thither, which is sometimes so strong, that in the <i>Moon's</i> decrease
  I have often <i>distinctly</i> seen <i>all</i> the parts of the
  <i>Moon</i>, that were <i>not enlightned</i> by the <i>Sun</i>, together
  with the difference of the clear parts, and the Spots, so far as to be
  able to discern them all. The <i>Shaddows</i> also of all the
  <i>Cavities</i> of the <i>Moon</i> seem to be stronger, than they would
  be, if there were a <i>Second</i> Light. For, although a far off, the
  shaddows of our Bodies, environed with Light, seem to Us almost dark; yet
  they doe not so appear so much, as the Shaddows of the <i>Moon</i> doe;
  and those that are upon the <i>Edge</i> of the <i>Section</i>, <!-- Page
  123 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page123"></a>{123}</span>should not
  appear in the like manner. But, I will determine nothing of any of these
  things. When I shall hereafter have made more frequent Observations of
  the Moon with my <i>great Telescopes</i>, in convenient time, I shall
  then perhaps learn more of it, than I know at present, at least it will
  excite the <i>Curious</i> to endeavor to make the like Observations; and
  it may be, others, that I have not thought of.</p>

<h3><i>The Instance of the </i>same Person<i> to Mr. </i>Hook<i>, for
communicating his Contrivance of making, with a
Glass of a Sphere of 20 or 40 foot </i>diameter<i>, a </i>Telescope<i>
drawing several hundred foot; and his offer
of recompensing that Secret with another, teaching
To measure with a </i>Telescope<i> the </i>Distances
of Objects<i> upon the Earth.</i></h3>

  <p>In <i>Numb.</i> 4. Of these <i>Papers</i>, pag. <a
  href="#page67">67</a>. Mr. <i>Hook</i> had intimated, that he would
  shortly discover a way of his, with a <i>Plane-convex</i> Glasse of a
  Sphære of 20. or 40. feet <i>Diameter</i>, without <i>Veines</i>, and
  truly wrought of that <i>Figure</i>, to make a <i>Telescope</i>, that
  with a single <i>Eye-glass</i> should draw 300, 400, yea 1000 feet,
  <i>without</i> at all <i>altering the Convexity</i>: Monsieur
  <i>Auzout</i> returns this consideration, and offer upon it, which
  follows:</p>

  <p>To perform (<i>saith he</i>) with a <i>lesser Object-glass</i> the
  effect of a <i>great Telescope</i>, we must find out a way to make such
  an <i>Object-glass</i> to receive as many Rayes as one will, without
  their being sensibly distant from one another; to the end, that by
  applying to it a <i>stronger Eye-glass</i>, there may be still Beams
  enough to see the Object, and to obliterate the small specks and
  imperfections of the <i>Eye-glass</i>. And if Mr. <i>Hook</i> hath this
  Invention, I esteem it one of the greatest, that can be found in the
  matter of <i>Telescopes</i>. If he please to impart it to us, we shall be
  obliged to him; and <!-- Page 124 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page124"></a>{124}</span>I wish, I had a secret in <i>Opticks</i>
  to encourage him to that communication. If I did believe, that this would
  be esteemed one, To measure with a <i>great Telescope</i> the <i>distance
  of Objects</i> upon the <i>Earth</i>; which I have found long since, and
  proposed to some by way of Paradox; <i>Locorum distantias ex unica
  statione, absque ullo Instrumento Mathematico, metiri</i>; I doe here
  promise to discover it to him, with the necessary Tables, as soon as He
  shall have imparted his to me; which I will use, as he shall order me.
  For, although the <i>Practise</i> doe not altogether answer the
  <i>Theory</i> of my Invention, because that the length of the
  <i>Telescopes</i> admits of some Latitude; yet one comes near enough, and
  perhaps as Just, as by most of the wayes, ordinarily used with
  Instruments. That, which I am proposing, I doubt not but M. <i>Hook</i>
  will soon understand, and see the determination of all Cases possible. I
  shall only say, that if we look upon the sole <i>Theory</i>, we make use
  of an ordinary <i>Telescope</i>, whereof the <i>Eye-glass</i> is to be
  <i>Convexe</i>: for, by putting the Glasses at a little greater distance,
  than they are, proportionably to the distance for which it is to serve,
  and by adding to it a <i>new Eye-glass</i>, the Object will be seen
  distinct, though obscure; and if the <i>Eye-glass</i> be <i>Convexe</i>,
  the Object will appear erect. They may be done two manner of ways; either
  by leaving the <i>Telescope</i> in its ordinary situation, the
  <i>Object-glass</i> before the <i>Eye-glass</i>; or by inverting it, and
  putting <i>this</i> before <i>that</i>. But if any will make use of two
  <i>Object-glasses</i>, whereof the <i>Focus's</i> are known, the distance
  of them will be known. If it be supposed, that the <i>Focus</i> of the
  <i>first</i> be B. and <i>that</i> of the <i>second</i> C, and the
  distance given, B + 2D, and that D <i>minus</i> C, be <i>equal</i> to F;
  for, this distance will be <i>equal</i> to B + C + F - rF² - C². And if
  you have the <i>Focus</i> of the <i>first Object-glass</i>, equal to B,
  the distance, where you will put the <i>second</i> Glass equal to B + C +
  D, the <i>focus</i> of the 2d Glasse will be found equal to
  <sup>CD</sup>/<sub>C+D</sub>. And if you will that the Object shall be
  magnified as much with these two Glasses, as it would be with a single
  one, whereof the <i>Focus</i> <!-- Page 125 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page125"></a>{125}</span>should be of the distance given, having
  the <i>Focus</i> of the <i>Object-glass</i> given equal to B, and the
  distance to B + D; the distance between the first and the second Glass
  will be equal to <sup>2B² + 2BD</sup>/<sub>2B + D</sub>, whence
  subducting B (the <i>Focus</i> of the <i>Object-glass</i> given) there
  remains <sup>BD</sup>/<sub>2B + D</sub>; and if this sum be supposed
  equal to C, we shall easily know, by the preceding Rule, the <i>Focus</i>
  of the <i>second</i> Glass.</p>

  <p>So far M. <i>Auzout</i>, who, I trust, will receive due satisfaction
  to his desire, as soon as the happy end of the present Contagion shall
  give a beginning and life again to the Studies and Actions of our retired
  <i>Philosophers</i>.</p>

  <p>I shall onely here adde, That the Secret he mentions [<i>Of measuring
  the distance of Places by a Telescope (fitted for that purpose) and from
  one Station</i>] is a thing already known (if I am not mis-informed) to
  some Members of our Society; who have been a good while since considering
  of it, and have contrived ways for the doing of it: Whether the same with
  those of Mr. <i>Auzout</i>, I know not. Nor have I (at the distance that
  I am now from them) opportunity of particular Information.</p>

<h3><i>An Experiment of a way of preparing a Liquor, that
shall sink into, and colour the whole Body of </i>Marble<i>,
causing a </i>Picture<i>, drawn on a surface, to
appear also in the </i>inmost<i> parts of the Stone.</i></h3>

  <p>This <i>Experiment</i>, having been hinted at in the next foregoing
  <i>Papers</i>, out of the <i>Mundus Subterraneus</i> of <i>Athanasius
  Kircher</i>, and several Curious Persons, who either have not the leisure
  to read Voluminous Authors, or are not readily skilled in that Learned
  Tongue wherein the said Book is written, being very desirous to have it
  transferred hither, it was thought fit to comply with their desire
  herein.</p>

  <p>The Author therefore of the <i>Mundus</i>, &amp;c, having seen <!--
  Page 126 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page126"></a>{126}</span>some
  stones reputed to be <i>natural</i> that had most lively Pictures, not
  only upon them, but passing <i>thorow</i> their whole substance, and
  thereupon finding an <i>Artist</i>; skilful to perform such rare
  workmanship, did not only pronounce such stones to be <i>artificial</i>,
  but when that <i>Artist</i> was unwilling to communicate unto him his
  Secret, did joyn his study and endeavors with those of one <i>Albertus
  Gunter</i> a <i>Saxon</i>, to find it out themselves: wherein having
  succeeded, it seems, they made the Experiments which this Industrious and
  communicative <i>Jesuit</i> delivers in this manner:</p>

  <p>The Colours, saith he, are thus prepared; I take of <i>Aqua fortis</i>
  and <i>Aqua Regis</i>, two ounces <i>ana</i>; of <i>Sal Armoniack</i> one
  ounce; of the best <i>Spirit of Wine</i>, two drachms; as much
  <i>Gold</i> as can be had for nine <i>Julio</i>'s (a <i>Julio</i> being
  about six pence English) of pure <i>Silver</i>, two drachmes. These
  things being provided, let the Silver, when calcined, be put into a Vial;
  and having powred upon it the two drachmes of <i>Aqua fortis</i>, let it
  evaporate, and you shall have a Water yielding first a <i>blew</i>
  Colour, and afterwards a <i>black</i>. Likewise put the Gold, when
  calcin'd, into a Vial, and having powred the <i>Aqua Regis</i> upon it,
  set it by to evaporate: then put the <i>Spirit of Wine</i> upon the
  <i>Sal Armoniack</i>, leaving it also till it be evaporated; and you will
  have a Golden coloured Water, which will afford you divers Colours. And,
  after this manner, you may extract many <i>Tinctures</i> of Colours out
  of other Mettals. This done, you may, by the means of these two Waters,
  paint what Picture you please upon white Marble, of the <i>softer</i>
  kind, renewing the Figure every day for several days with some fresh
  superadded Liquor, and you shall find in time, that the Picture hath
  penetrated the <i>whole</i> solidity of the Stone, so that cutting it
  into as many parts as you will, it will always represent unto you the
  same Figure on both sides.</p>

  <p><i>So far he</i>, which how far it answers expectation, is referred to
  the Tryal of Ingenious Artists. In the mean time there are not wanting
  Experienced Men that scruple the Effect, but <!-- Page 127 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page127"></a>{127}</span>yet are far from
  pronouncing any thing positively against it, so that they doe not
  discourage any that have conveniencies, from trying.</p>

  <p>But whether the way there mentioned will succeed, or not, according to
  expectation: Sure it is that a Stone-cutter in <i>Oxford</i>, Mr.
  <i>Bird</i>, hath many years since found out a way of doing the same
  thing, in effect, that is here mentioned; and hath practised it for many
  years. That is, he is able so to apply a colour to the outside of
  polished Marble, as that it shall sink a considerable depth into the body
  of the stone; and there represent like figures or images as those are on
  the outside; (deeper or shallower according as he continues the
  application, a longer, or lesser while.) Of which kind there be divers
  pieces to be seen in <i>Oxford</i>, <i>London</i>, and elsewhere. And
  some of them being shewed to his Majesty, soon after his happy
  restauration, they were broken in his presence, and found to answer
  expectation. And others may be dayly seen, by any who is curious, or
  desirous to see it.</p>

<h3><i>An Intimation of a Way, found in </i>Europe<i> to make

  <p>Notice was lately given by an inquisitive <i>Parisian</i> to a friend

  making as good <i>Porcelane</i> as is made in <i>China</i> it self, and
  transparent; adding that he had seen him make some.</p>

<h3><i>An Account of an odd </i>Spring<i> in </i>Westphalia<i>, together
with an Information touching </i>Salt-Springs<i> and
the straining of salt-water.</i></h3>

  <p>An observing Gentleman did lately write out of <i>Germany</i>, that in
  <i>Westphalia</i> in the Diocess of <i>Paderborn</i>, is a Spring, which
  looses it self twice in 24 houres; coming always, after 6 houres, back
  again with a great noise, and so forcibly, as <!-- Page 128 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page128"></a>{128}</span>to drive 3 Mills not
  far from its source. The Inhabitants call it the <i>Bolderborn</i>, as if
  you should say, the <i>Boysterous Spring</i>.</p>

  <p><i>The same Person</i>, having mentioned the many <i>Salt-Springs</i>
  in <i>Germany</i>, as those at <i>Lunenburg</i>, at <i>Hall</i> in
  <i>Saxony</i>, at <i>Saltzwedel</i> in <i>Brandenburger Mark</i>, in
  <i>Tyrol</i>, &amp;c. observes, that no Salt-water, which contains any
  Metal with it, can well be sodden to Salt in a Vessel of the same Metal,
  which it self contains, except <i>Vitriol</i> in Copper Vessels.</p>

  <p><i>He adds</i>, that, to separate Salt from Salt-water, without Fire,
  if you take a Vessel of Wax, hollow within, and every where tight; and
  plunge it into the Sea, or into other Salt-water, there will be made such
  a separation, that the vessel shall be full of sweet water, the Salt
  staying behind: but, though this water have no saltish taste, yet, <i>he
  saith</i>, there will be found a Salt in the Essay, which is the Spirit
  of Salt, subtile enough with the water to penetrate the Wax.</p>

<h3><i>An Account of the Rise and Attempts, of a Way to
conveigh Liquors immediately into the Mass of
Blood.</i></h3>

  <p>Whereas there have lately appeared in publick some <i>Books</i>,
  printed beyond the Seas, treating of the Way of <i>Injecting liquors into
  Veines</i>; in which Books the <i>Original</i> of the <i>Invention</i>
  seems to be adscribed to others, besides him, to whom it really belongs;
  It will surely not be thought amiss, if something be said, whereby the
  true <i>Inventor's</i> right may beyond exception be asserted &amp;
  preserved; To which end, there will need no more, than barely to
  represent the <i>Time</i> when, and the <i>Place</i> where, &amp; among
  whom it was first started and put to tryal. To joyn all these
  circumstances together, 'Tis notorious, that at least six years since (a
  good while before it was heard off, that any one did pretend to have so
  much as thought of it) the Learned and Ingenious Dr. <i>Christopher
  Wren</i> did propose in the <i>University</i> of <i>Oxford</i> (where he
  now is the Worthy Savilian Professor of <i>Astronomy</i>, and where very
  many Curious Persons are ready to <!-- Page 129 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page129"></a>{129}</span>attest this relation)
  to that Noble Benefactor to Experimental Philosophy, Mr. <i>Robert
  Boyle</i>, Dr. <i>Wilkins</i>, and other deserving Persons, That he
  thought, he could easily contrive a Way to conveigh any liquid thing
  immediately into the Mass of Blood; <i>videl</i>: By making Ligatures on
  the Veines, and then opening them on the side of the Ligature towards the
  Heart, and by putting into them slender Syringes or Quills, fastened to
  Bladders (in the manner of Clyster-pipes) containing the matter to be
  injected; performing that Operation upon pretty big and lean doggs, that
  the Vessels might be large enough and easily accessible.</p>

  <p>This Proposition being made, M. <i>Boyle</i> soon gave order for an
  <i>Apparatus</i>, to put it to Experiment; wherein at several times, upon
  several Doggs, <i>Opium</i> &amp; the Infusion of <i>Crocus
  Metallorum</i> were injected into that part of the hind-legs of those
  Animals, whence the larger Vessels, that carry the Blood, are most easy
  to be taken hold of: whereof the success was, that the <i>Opium</i>,
  being soon circulated into the Brain, did within a short time stupify,
  though not kill the Dog; but a large Dose of the <i>Crocus
  Metallorum</i>, made another Dog vomit up Life and all: All which is more
  amply and circumstantially delivered by Mr. <i>Boyle</i> in his Excellent
  Book of the <i>Usefulness of Experimental Philosophy</i>, Part 2. Essay
  2. pag. 53. 54. 55. Where 'tis also mention'd, that the fame of this
  Invention and of the succeeding Tryals being spread, and particularly
  coming to the knowledge of a foreign <i>Ambassadour</i>, that was
  Curious, and then resided in <i>London</i>, it was by him tryed with some
  <i>Crocus Metallorum</i>, upon a Malefactor, that was an inferiour
  Servant of his; with this success, that the Fellow, as soon as ever the
  Injection began to be made, did, either really or craftily, fall into a
  swoon; whereby, being unwilling to prosecute so hazardous an Experiment,
  they desisted, without seeing any other effect of it, save that it was
  told the Ambassadour, that it wrought once downwards with him: Since
  which time, it hath been frequently practised both in <i>Oxford</i> &amp;
  <i>London</i>; as well before the <i>Royal Society</i>, as elsewhere. And
  particularly that Learned <!-- Page 130 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page130"></a>{130}</span>Physitian, Dr. <i>Timothy Clerk</i>, hath
  made it part of his business, to pursue those Experiments with much
  industry, great accurateness, and considerable observations thereon;
  which above two years since, were by him produced and read before the
  <i>Royal Society</i>, who thereupon desired him, as one of their Members,
  to compleat, what he had proposed to himself upon that subject, and then
  to publish the same: the Effect whereof 'tis hoped, will now shortly
  appear, and not prove unwelcome to the Curious.</p>

  <p>Some whereof, though they may conceive, that liquors thus injected
  into Veines without preparation and digestion, will make odde, commotions
  in the Blood, disturb Nature, and cause strange Symptoms in the Body, yet
  they have other thoughts on Liquors, that are prepared of such things, as
  have passed the Digestion of the Stomach; for example, of Spirit of
  Urine, of Harts-horne, of Blood &amp;c. And they hope likewise, that
  besides the <i>Medical</i> Uses, that may be made of this
  <i>Invention</i>, it may also serve for <i>Anatomical</i> purposes, by
  filling, after this way, the vessels of an Animal as full, as they can
  hold, and by exceedingly distending them, discover <i>New</i> Vessels,
  &amp;c: But not now to enlarge upon the Uses, the Reader may securely
  take this Narrative, as the naked real Matter of Fact, whereby 'tis as
  clear, as Noon day (both from the Time, and irrefragable Testimony of
  very many considerable Persons in that University, who can jointly attest
  it; as well as from that particular unquestionable one of Mr.
  <i>Boyle</i> and his worthy Company, who were the first Eye-witnesses of
  the Tryals made,) that to <i>Oxford</i>, and in it, to Dr. <i>Christopher
  Wren</i>, this Invention is due; and consequently, that all others, who
  discourse or write of it, doe either derive it from Him, or are fallen
  upon the same Devise several years after Him.</p>

<h3><i>An Account of the Tryalls, made in </i>Italy<i> of </i>Campani's<i>
new </i>Optick Glasses<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>An Inquisitive <i>Parisian</i> writes to his Correspondent in
  <i>London</i>, as follows;</p>

  <p>We received lately news from <i>Rome</i>, from a very Curious Person
  of our acquaintance, importing, that <i>Campani</i> hath had the
  advantage of <i>Divini</i>. The Great Duke of <i>Toskany</i>, and Prince
  <i>Leopold</i>, his Brother, upon Tryal, made of both their Glasses, have
  found those of <i>Campani</i> excel the other, and with them they have
  been able, easily to distinguish people <!-- Page 132 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page132"></a>{132}</span>at 4 Leagues distance:
  Of which I intend you more particulars hereafter.</p>

  <p>Among them are expected the <i>Length</i> of these <i>Telescopes</i>,
  and the Largeness of the <i>Aperture</i> of their <i>Object-glasses</i>.
  In the mean time, the <i>Parabolical-glasses</i>, formerly mentioned to
  be in hand here at <i>London</i>, are finishing with all possible care
  and industry.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<h3><i>A Further Relation of the </i>Whale-fishing<i> about the
</i>Bermudas<i>, and on the Coast of </i>New-England<i> and
</i>New-Netherland<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>The same Person, that communicated the particulars about the new
  Whale-fishing near the <i>Bermudas</i>, mentioned in the first of these
  <i>Tracts</i>, gives this further Information; That there have been since
  taken by order of the <i>Bermudas</i> Company, sixteen of those Whales,
  the Oyle whereof, to the quantity of 50 or 60 Tuns arrived in
  <i>Ireland</i> at <i>Limrick</i>, some few months agoe.</p>

  <p>He adds, that about two years since, there stranded upon the Coast of
  <i>New-England</i> a dead Whale, of that sort, which they call
  <i>Trumpo</i>, having Teeth resembling those of a Mill, and its mouth at
  a good distance from, and under the Nose or Trunk, and several boxes or
  partitions in the Nose, like those of the Tailes in Lobsters; and that
  that being open'd there run out of it a thin oily substance, which would
  candy in time; after which, the remainder, being a thick fatty substance,
  was taken out of the same part, with a scoope. And this substance he
  affirmed to be the <i>Sperma Ceti</i>; adding further, that the
  <i>Blubber</i>, as they call it, it self, of the same sort of Whales,
  when stewed, yields on the top a creamy substance, which taken off, and
  thrown upon white <span class="correction" title="Original reads `lime', corrected by errata, page 162."
  >wine,</span> lets fall a dirty heterogeneous sediment, but what remains
  aloft, affords a <i>Sperma-Ceti</i>-like matter. <!-- Page 133 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page133"></a>{133}</span></p>

  <p>He concluded his relation with observing, that these whales were to be
  met with, between the Coast of <i>New-England</i>, and
  <i>New-Netherland</i>, where they might be caught eight or nine months in
  the year, whereas those about the <i>Bermudas</i> are to be found there
  only in the Months of <i>February</i>, <i>March</i> and <i>April</i>.</p>

  <p>Concerning the death of the Whale, which hath been related to have
  stranded upon <i>New-England</i>, it is not very improbable, but, (that
  Fish having also more than one Enemy, whereof a small Fish called the
  <span class="correction" title="Original reads `Tresher', corrected by errata, page 162."
  ><i>Thresher</i></span> is one, who, by Mr. <i>Terry's</i> Relation in
  his <i>East-Indian</i> Voyage, with his nimbleness vexes him as much, as
  a Bee does a great Beast on the land; and a certain horny Fish another,
  who runs its horn into the Whal's belly) it may have been kill'd by the
  latter of these two; which kind of Fish is known, sometimes to run its
  horn into Ships (perhaps taking them for Whales) and there snapping it
  asunder; as hapned not long since to an English Vessel in the
  <i>West-Indian</i> Seas; the broken piece of that Horn being by the
  Master of that ship presented to the King, and now kept in His Majesties
  Repository: the like whereof befel a <i>French</i> Vessel, sailing
  towards the <i>East-Indies</i>, according to the Relation, made by
  Monsieur <i>Thevenot</i> in his second <i>Tome</i> of <i>Curious
  Voyages</i>.</p>

<h3><i>Of a remarkable Spring, about </i>Paderborn<i> in </i>Germany<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>An inquiring Gentleman of those parts writes to his Friend in
  <i>London</i>, as follows;</p>

  <p>In this Diocess of <i>Paderborn</i>, about 2 leagues from that Town,
  is a treble Spring call'd <i>Metborn</i>, which has three streams, two
  wherof are not above one foot and a half distant from one another, and
  yet of so differing qualities, that whereas one of them is limpid,
  blewish, lukewarm, bubling, and holding Sal-armoniack, Ochra, Iron,
  Vitriol, <!-- Page 134 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page134"></a>{134}</span>Allum, Sulphur, Niter, Orpiment, used
  against Epilepsie, bad Spleens, and the Wormes; the other is Ice-cold,
  turbid and whitish, much stronger in tast, and heavier than the former,
  holding much Orpiment, Salt, Iron, Niter, and some Sal-Armoniack, Allum
  and Vitriol; Of this all Birds, observed to drink of it, doe dye; which I
  have also privately experimented by taking some of it home, and giving it
  to Hens, after I had given them Oates, Barly and Bread-crums; For, soon
  after they had drunk of it, they became giddy, reeled, and tumbled upon
  their backs, with convulsion-fitts, and so dyed with a great extention of
  their leggs. Giving them common-salt immediatly after they had drunk;
  they dyed not so soon; giving them vineger, they dyed not at all, but
  seven or eight days after were troubled with the <i>Pipp</i>. Those that
  dyed, being open'd, their Lungs were found quite shrivelled together. Yet
  some men, that are troubled with Worms, taking a litle quantity of it,
  and diluting it in common water, have been observed by this means to kill
  the Worms in their bellies, so that a great number of worms come from
  them; whereupon though they are sick, yet they dye not. As to the third
  stream, that lyes lower than the other two, about 20 paces distant from
  them, it is of a greenish colour, very clear, and of a sowre sweet tast,
  pleasing enough. It hath about a middle weight between the other two;
  whence wee guess, that it is mixed of them both, meeting there together:
  to confirm which, we have mixed equal quantities, of those two, with an
  addition of a litle common well-water, and have found that they, being
  stirred together and permitted to setle, made just a water of the same
  colour and tast of this third stream.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<h3><i>Of some other not-common Springs at </i>Basel<i> and in
</i>Alsatia<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>A Curious Person writes from those Places in manner following; <!--
  Page 135 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page135"></a>{135}</span></p>

  <p>At <i>Basel</i> the Spring, running in the <i>Gerbergasse</i> (or
  <i>Tanners-street</i>) from St. <i>Leonard's</i> Hill, is of a Blewish
  colour, and somewhat troubled, holding Copper, Bitumen, and Antimony,
  about 3 parts of the first, one of the second, and two of the last, as
  has been examined by skilful Persons. Our Tanners do water their Skins in
  it; and being a well-tasted and wholesome Water, it is both much drunk,
  and used to Bath in. It mingles with another Spring water, call'd the
  <i>Birsick</i>, and with it, between the <i>Salt-tower</i> and the
  <i>Rhine-gate</i> runs into the <i>Rhine</i>.</p>

  <p>In the same Town (which abounds with Spring-waters) there are two,
  among the rest, called <i>Bandulph's-well</i>, and <i>Brun Zum
  Brunnen</i>, that are more observable then the other; the former of them
  having a <i>Camphory</i> and drying Quality, and used against Hydropical
  Distempers; the latter containing some Sulphur, Saltpeter and Gold, and
  being an excellent Water to drink, much used in the principal Tavern of
  the City, where the chief of the Town do resort, and near which it
  runs.</p>

  <p>In <i>Alsatia</i> in the Valley, called <i>Leberthal</i>, near
  <i>Geesbach</i> (an ancient Mine-work) there runs out of a <i>Cavern</i>
  a foul, fattish, oily Liquor, which, though the Country-men of that place
  employ to the vile use of greasing their Wheels, instead of ordinary
  Wheel-grease; yet doth it afford an excellent Balsom, by taking a
  quantity of it, and putting it in an Earthen Pot well luted, that no
  steam may exhale; and then with a gentle Fire at first, but a stronger
  afterwards, boyling it for three hours together; in which space it will
  boyl in a fourth part, and an Earthen Matter, like Pitch, will settle it
  self at the bottom: but on the top thereof, when cold, there will swim a
  fatty Substance, like Lyne-Oyl, limped and somewhat yellowish, which is
  to be decanted from the thick Sediment, and then gently distilled in an
  Alembick in <i>Arena</i>, by which means, there will come over two
  differing Liquors, one Phlegmatick, the other Oily, <!-- Page 136
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page136"></a>{136}</span>which latter
  swimming on the Phlegm, is to be severed from it. The Phlegm is used as
  an excellent Resister and Curer of all the Putrefactions of the Lungs and
  Liver, and it heals all foul Wounds and Ulcers. The Oily part, being
  diluted with double its quantity of distilled Vineger, and brought three
  times over the Helm, yields a rare Balsom, against all inward and outward
  Corruptions, stinking Ulcers, hereditary Scurfs and Scabs: 'Tis also much
  used against Apoplexies, Palsies, Consumptions, Giddinesses, and
  Head-aches. Inwardly they take it with Succory-water against all
  corruptions of the Lungs. It is a kind of <i>Petroleum</i>, and contains
  no other Mineral Juice, but that of <i>Sulphur</i>, which seems to be
  thus distilled by <i>Nature</i> under ground; the distillation of an Oyl
  out of <i>Sulphur</i> by Art, being not so easie to perform.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<h3><i>Of the richest </i>Salt-Springs<i> in </i>Germany<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>An Account having been desired of those two chief <i>Salt-Springs</i>
  in <i>Germany</i>, at <i>Hall</i> and <i>Lunenburg</i>, it was lately
  transmitted thus:</p>

  <p>The <i>Salt-Springs</i> at <i>Hall</i> in <i>Saxony</i> are four,
  called <i>Gutiaar</i>, the <i>Dutch-Spring</i>, the <i>Mettritz</i>, and
  the <i>Hackel-dorn</i>; whereof the three first hold near the same
  proportion of Salt; the last hold less, but yields the purest Salt. The
  three first hold about seven parts of Salt, three of Marcasit, and
  fourteen of water: They are, besides their Oeconomical use, employed
  Medicinally to Bath in, and to draw a Spirit out of it, exhibited with
  good success against Venom, and the putrefaction of the Lungs, Liver,
  Reins, and the Spleen.</p>

  <p>The <i>Salt Water</i> at <i>Lunenburgh</i>, being more greenish then
  white, and not very transparent, is about the same nature and hold with
  that of <i>Hall</i>. It hath a mixture of Lead with it, whence also it
  will not be sod in Leaden Pans, and if it held no Lead at all, it would
  not be so good, that Metal being judged to <span class="correction"
  title="Original reads `putrefie', corrected by errata, page 162."
  ><i>purifie</i></span> the Water: whence also the Salt of <!-- Page 137
  --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page137"></a>{137}</span><i>Lunenburg</i> is preferred before all
  others, that are made of Salt Springs.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<h3><i>Some Observations of swarms of strange Insects,
and the Mischiefs done by them.</i></h3>

  <p>A great Observer, who hath lived long in <i>New England</i>, did upon
  occasion, relate to a Friend of his in <i>London</i>, where he lately
  was, That some few Years since there was such a swarm of a certain sort
  of Insects in that <i>English</i> Colony, that for the space of of 200
  Miles they poyson'd and destroyed all the Trees of that Country; there
  being found innumerable little holes in the ground, out of which those
  Insects broke forth in the form of <i>Maggots</i>, which turned into
  <i>Flyes</i> that had a kind of taile or sting, which they struck into
  the Tree, and thereby envenomed and killed it.</p>

  <p>The like Plague is said to happen frequently in the Country of the
  <i>Cosacks</i> or <i>Ukrani</i>, where in dry Summers they are infested
  with such swarms of <i>Locusts</i>, driven thither by an <i>East</i>, or
  <i>South-East</i> Wind, that they darken the Air in the fairest weather,
  and devour all the Corn of that Country; laying their Eggs in
  <i>Autumn</i>, and then dying; but the Eggs, of which every one layeth
  two or three hundred, hatching the next Spring, produce again such a
  number of Locusts, that then they do far more mischief than afore, unless
  Rains do fall, which kill both Eggs and the Insects themselves, or unless
  a strong <i>North</i> or <i>North-West</i> Wind arise, which drives them
  into the <i>Euxin</i> Sea: The Hogs of that Country loving these Eggs,
  devour also great quantities of them, and thereby help to purge the Land
  of them; which is often so molested by this Vermine, that they enter into
  their Houses and Beds, fall upon their Tables and into their Meat,
  insomuch that they can hardly eat without taking down some of them; in
  the Night when they repose themselves upon the ground, they cover it
  three, or four Inches thick, and if a Wheel pass <!-- Page 138 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page138"></a>{138}</span>over them, they emit a
  stench hardly to be endured: All which, and much more may be fully seen
  in the <i>French</i> Description of the Countries of <i>Poland</i>, made
  by <i>Monsieur de Beauplan</i>, and by <i>Monsieur Thevenot</i>, in his
  Relation of the <i>Cosacks</i>, contained in the First part of his
  <i>Curious Voyages</i>.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<h3><i>An Observation touching the Bodies of Snakes and
Vipers.</i></h3>

  <p>Several have taken notice, that there is a difference between the
  brooding of Snakes and Vipers, those laying their Eggs in Dung-hills, by
  whose warmth they are hatched; but these (Vipers) brooding their Eggs
  within their Bellies, and bringing forth live Vipers. To which may be
  added, That some affirm to have seen Snakes lye upon their Eggs, as Hens
  sit upon theirs.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<h3><i>Some Observations of odde Constitutions of Bodies.</i></h3>

  <p>A very curious Person, studying Physick at <i>Leyden</i>, to whom had
  been imparted those Relations about a Milky Substance in Veins,
  heretofore alledged in <i>Numb.</i> 6. returns, by way of gratitude, the
  following Observations.</p>

  <p>There was (saith he) not many Years since, in this Country a Student,
  who being much addicted to the study of <i>Astronomy</i>, and spending
  very many Nights in Star-gazing, had, by the Nocturnal wet and cold
  temper of the Air, in such a manner obstructed the pores of his skin,
  that little or nothing exhaled from his Body; which appeared hence,
  because that the shirt, he had worn five or six weeks, was then as white
  as if he had worn it but one day. In the mean while he gathered a
  subcutaneous Water, of which yet he was afterwards well cured.</p>

  <p>We have also (<i>saith the same</i>) seen here a young Maid, of about
  thirteen Years of age, which from the time that she was but six Years
  old, and began to be about her Mother in <!-- Page 139 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page139"></a>{139}</span>the Kitchin, would, as
  often as she was bid to bring her Salt, or could else come at it, fill
  her Pockets therewith, and eat it, as other children doe Sugar: whence
  she was so dried up, and grown so stiff, that she could not stirre her
  limbs, and was thereby starved to death.</p>

  <p>That Learned and Observing Doctor <i>John Beal</i>, upon the perusal
  of the forementioned <i>Numb.</i> 6. was pleased to communicate this
  Note:</p>

  <p>To your Observation, of Milk in Veines, I can add a <i>Phænomenon</i>
  of some resemblance to it, which I received above 20 years agoe from
  <i>Thomas Day</i>, an Apothecary in <i>Cambridg</i>; <i>vid.</i> That
  himself let a man bloud in the arme, by order of Doctor <i>Eade</i>, a
  Physitian there. The mans bloud was white as Milk, as it run out of his
  arme, it had a little dilute redness, but immediately, as it fell into
  the Vessel, it was presently white; and it continued like drops of Milk
  on the pavement, where ever it fell. The conjecture which the said
  Physitian had of the cause of this appearance, was, that the Patient had
  much fed on Fish; affirming withall, that he had soon been a Leper, if
  not prevented by Physick.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<h3><i>A way of preserving Ice and Snow by Chaffe.</i></h3>

  <p>The Ingenious Mr. <i>William Ball</i> did communicate the relation
  hereof, as he had received it from his Brother, now residing at
  <i>Livorne</i>, as follows;</p>

  <p>The Snow, or Ice-houses are here commonly built on the side of a steep
  hill, being only a deep hole in the ground, by which meanes, they easily
  make a passage out from the bottom of it, to carry away all the water,
  which, if it should remain stagnating therein, would melt the Ice and
  Snow: but they thatch it with straw, in the shape of a Saucepan-cover,
  that the rain may not come at it. The sides (supposing it dry) they line
  not with any thing, as is done in St. <i>Jeames</i>'s Park, by reason of
  the moistness of the ground. This Pit they fill <!-- Page 140 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page140"></a>{140}</span>full of Snow or Ice
  (taking care that the Ice be made of the purest water, because they put
  it into their wine) over-spreading first the bottom very well with
  <i>Chaffe</i>; by which I mean not any part of the straw, but what
  remains upon the winnowing of the Corn; and I think, they here use
  Barley-chaffe. This done, they further, as they put in the Ice, or the
  Snow, (which latter they ram down,) line it thick by the sides with such
  Chaffe, and afterwards cover it well with the same; and in half a years
  lying so, 'tis found not to want above an eight part of what it weighed,
  when first put in. When ever they take it out into the Aire, they wrap it
  in this Chaffe, and it keeps to admiration. The use of it in
  <i>England</i> would not be so much for cooling of drinks, as 'tis here
  generally used; but for cooling of fruits, sweetmeats &amp;c. <i>So far
  this Author.</i></p>

  <p>The other usual way both in <i>Italy</i> and other Countries, to
  conserve Snow and Ice with <i>Straw</i> or <i>Reed</i>, is set down so
  punctually by Mr. <i>Boyle</i> in his <i>Experimental History of
  Cold</i>, pag. 408. 409. that nothing is to be added. It seems
  <i>Pliny</i> could not pass by these <i>Conservatories</i>, and the
  cooling of drinks with Ice, without passing this severe, though elegant
  and witty, Animadversion upon them: <i>Hi Nives, illi glaciem potant,
  p&oelig;násque montium in voluptatem gulæ vertunt: Servatur algor

  <p>It being the Design of the <i>R. Society</i>, for the better attaining
  the End of their Institution, to study <i>Nature</i> rather than
  <i>Books</i>, and from the Observations, made of the <i>Phænomena</i> and
  Effects she presents, to compose such a <!-- Page 141 --><span

  hereafter serve to build a Solid and Useful Philosophy upon; They have
  from time to time given order to several of their Members to draw up both
  <i>Inquiries</i> of things Observable in forrain Countries, and
  <i>Directions</i> for the Particulars, they desire chiefly to be informed
  about. And considering with themselves, how much they may increase their
  <i>Philosophical</i> stock by the advantage, which <i>England</i> injoyes
  of making Voyages into all parts of the World, they formerly appointed
  that Eminent Mathematician and Philosopher Master <i>Rooke</i>, one of
  their Fellowes, and <i>Geometry</i> Professor of <i>Gresham Colledge</i>
  (now deceased to the great detriment of the Common-wealth of Learning) to
  think upon and set down some <i>Directions</i> for <i>Sea-men</i> going
  into the <i>East</i> &amp; <i>West-Indies</i>, the better to capacitate
  them for making such observations abroad, as may be pertinent and
  suitable for their purpose; of which the said Sea-men should be desired
  to keep an exact <i>Diary</i>, delivering at their return a fair Copy
  thereof to the <i>Lord High Admiral</i> of <i>England</i>, his Royal
  Highness the <i>Duke</i> of <i>York</i>, and another to
  <i>Trinity-house</i> to be perused by the <i>R. Society</i>. Which
  <i>Catalogue</i> of <i>Directions</i> having been drawn up accordingly by
  the said Mr. <i>Rook</i>, and by him presented to those, who appointed
  him to expedite such an one, it was thought not to be unseasonable at
  this time to make it publique, the more conveniently to furnish
  Navigators with Copies thereof. They are such, as follow;</p>

  <p>1. To observe the Declination of the <i>Compass</i>, or its Variation
  from the <i>Meridian</i> of the place, frequently; marking withal, the
  <i>Latitude</i> and <i>Longitude</i> of the place, wherever such
  Observation is made, as exactly as may be, and setting down the
  <i>Method</i>, by which they made them.</p>

  <p>2. To carry <i>Dipping Needles</i> with them, and observe the
  Inclination of the Needle in like manner.</p>

  <p>3. To remark carefully the Ebbings and Flowings of the Sea, in as many
  places as they can, together with all the <span class="correction"

  Perpendicular distance there is between the highest Tide and lowest Ebb,
  during the Spring-Tides and Neap-Tides; what day of the <i>Moons</i> age,
  and at times of the year, the highest and lowest Tides fall out: And all

  <p>4. To make Plotts and Draughts of prospect of Coasts, Promontories,
  Islands and Ports, marking the Bearings and Distances, as neer as they
  can.</p>

  <p>5. To sound and marke the Depths of Coasts and Ports, and such other

<h3><i>Some Observations concerning </i>Jupiter<i>. Of the shadow
of one of his </i>Satellites<i> seen, by a Telescope
passing over the Body of </i>Jupiter<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>I have received an Account from very good hands, That on the
  26<sup>th.</sup> of <i>September</i> last, at half hour after seven of
  the Clock, was seen, both in <i>Holland</i> and in <i>France</i> (by
  curious Observers, with very good Telescopes) the shadow of one of the
  <i>Satellites</i> of <i>Jupiter</i>, passing over his Body. One of those
  small Stars moving about his Body (which are therefore called his
  <i>Satellites</i>) coming between the Sun and it, made a small Eclipse,
  appearing in the Face of <i>Jupiter</i> as a little round black Spot. The
  Particulars of those Observations, when they shall come to our Hands, we
  may (if need be) make them publik: Which Observations, as they are in
  themselves very remarkable, and argue the Excellency of the Glasses by
  which they were discovered; So are we, in part, beholding to Monsieur
  <i>Cassini</i> for them, who giving notice before hand of such
  Appearances to be expected, gave occasion to those Curious Observers to
  look for them.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<h3><i>Of a permanent Spot in </i>Jupiter<i>: by which is manifested
the conversion of </i>Jupiter<i> about his own
Axis.</i></h3>

  <p>Besides that Transient Shadow last mentioned, there hath been
  observed, by Monsieur <i>Cassini</i>, a permanent Spot in the Disque of
  <i>Jupiter</i>; by the help whereof, he hath been able to observe, not
  onely that <i>Jupiter</i> turns about upon his own Axis, but also the
  Time of such conversion; which he <!-- Page 144 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page144"></a>{144}</span>estimates to be, 9
  hours and 56 minutes.</p>

  <p>For as <i>Kepler</i> did before conjecture, from the motion of the
  Primitive Planets about the Sun as their Center, that the Sun moved about
  its own Axis, but could not prove it, till by <i>Galileo</i> and
  <i>Shiner</i> the Spots in the Sun were discovered; so it hath been
  thought reasonable, from the Secundary Planets moving about
  <i>Jupiter</i>, that <i>Jupiter</i> is also moved about his Axis; yet,
  till now, it hath not been evinced by Observation, That it doth so move;
  much less, in what Period of Time. And the like reason there is to judge
  so of <i>Saturn</i>, because of the Secundary Planet discovered by
  Monsieur <i>Hugens de Zulichem</i> to move about it; (though such motion
  be not yet evinced from Observation:) as well as that of the
  <i>Earth</i>, from its Attendant the <i>Moon</i>.</p>

  <p>Whether the same may be also concluded of the other Planets,
  <i>Mars</i>, <i>Venus</i>, and <i>Mercury</i>, (about whom have not yet
  been observed any Secondary Planets to move,) is not so evident. Yet
  there may be somewhat of like probability in those. Not onely, because it
  is possible they may have Secundary Planets about them, though not yet
  discovered; (For, we know, it was long after those of <i>Jupiter</i>,
  before that about <i>Saturn</i> was discovered; and who knows, what after
  times may discover about the rest?) But because the Primary Planets being
  all in like manner inlightned by the Sun, and (in all likely hood) moved
  by it; it is likely that they be moved by the same Laws and Methods; and
  therefore, turn'd about their own Axis, as it is manifest that some of
  them are.</p>

  <p>But, as for the Secundary Planets, as well those about <i>Jupiter</i>,
  as that about <i>Saturn</i>; it is most likely that they have no such
  Rotation upon their Axis. Not so much because, by reason of their
  smalness, no such thing hath been yet observed, (or, indeed, could be,
  though it were true;) But because they being Analogical to our
  <i>Moon</i>, it is most likely that they are moved in like manner. Now,
  though it be <!-- Page 145 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page145"></a>{145}</span>true, that there is some kind of
  <i>Libration</i> of the Moon's body, so that we have not precisely just
  the same part of it looking towards us; (as is evident by <i>Hevelius</i>
  observations, and others;) yet is there no Revolution upon its Axis; the
  same part of it, with very little alteration, always respecting us, as is
  to be seen in <i>Hevelius</i> his Tratise <i>de Motu Lunæ Libratorio</i>,
  and indeed, by all those who have written particularly of the spots on
  the Moon; and is universally known to all that have with any curiosity
  viewed it with Telescopes.</p>

<h3><i>An </i>Appendix<i> to the </i>Directions<i> for Seamen,
bound for far Voyages.</i></h3>

  <p>Whereas it may be of good use, both <i>Naval</i> and
  <i>Philosophical</i>, to know, both how to sound depths of the sea
  <i>without a Line</i>, and to fetch up water from any depth of the same;
  the following waies have been contrived by Mr. <i>Hook</i> to perform
  both; (which should have been added to the lately printed <i>Directions
  for Seamen</i>, if then it could have been conveniently done.) <!-- Page
  148 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page148"></a>{148}</span></p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:23%;">
      <a href="images/VI_N9_Fig1.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/VI_N9_Fig1.png"
      alt="Fig. 1." title="Fig. 1." /></a>
  </div>
  <p><i>First</i>, for the sounding of depths without a Cord, consider
  <i>Figure</i> 1, and accordingly take a Globe of <i>Firr</i>, or
  <i>Maple</i>, or other light Wood, as A: let it be well secured by
  Vernish, Pitch, or otherwise, from imbibing water; then take a piece of
  Lead or Stone, D, considerably heavier then will sink the Globe: let
  there be a long Wire-staple B, in the Ball A, and a springing Wire C,
  with a bended end F, and into the said staple, press in with your fingers
  the springing Wire on the bended end: and on it hang the weight D, by its
  ring E, and so let Globe and all sink gently into the water, in the
  posture represented in the first <i>Figure</i>, to the bottom, where the
  weight D touching first, is thereby stopt; but the Ball, being by the
  <i>Impetus</i>, it acquired in descending, carried downwards a little
  after the weight is stopt, suffers the springing wire to fly back, and
  thereby sets it self at liberty to reascend. And, by observing the time
  of the Ball's stay under water (which may be done by a Watch, having
  minuts and seconds, or by a good Minut-glass, or best of all, by a
  Pendulum vibrating seconds) you will by this way, with the help of some
  <i>Tables</i>, come to know any depth of the sea.</p>

  <p>Note, that care must be had of proportioning the weight and shape of
  the Lead, to the bulk, weight, and figure of the Globe, after such a
  manner, as upon experience shall be found most convenient.</p>

  <p>In some of the Tryals already made with this Instrument, the Globe
  being of Maple-wood, well covered with Pitch to hinder soaking in, was
  5<sup>13</sup>/<sub>16</sub> inches in diameter, and weighed 2½ pounds:
  the Lead of 4½ pounds weight, was of a <i>Conical</i> figure, 11. inches
  long, with the sharper end downwards, 1<sup>9</sup>/<sub>16</sub> inches
  at the top, and <sup>1</sup>/<sub>16</sub> at <span class="correction"
  title="Original reads `the the'.">the</span> bottom in diameter. And in
  those Experiments, made in the <i>Thames</i>, in the depth of 19. foot
  water, there passed between the Immersion and Emersion of the Globe, 6.
  seconds of an hour; and in the depth of 10. foot water, there passed 3½
  seconds or thereabout: From many of which kind of Experiments it will
  likely not be hard to finde <!-- Page 149 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page149"></a>{149}</span>out a method to calculate, what depth is
  to be concluded from any other time of the like Globes stay under
  water.</p>

  <div class="figleft" style="width:20%;">
      <a href="images/VI_N9_Fig2.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/VI_N9_Fig2.png"
      alt="Fig. 2." title="Fig. 2." /></a>
  </div>
  <p>In the same Tryals, made with this Instrument in the said River of
  <i>Thames</i>, it has been found, that there is no difference in time,
  between the submersions of the Ball at the greatest depth, when it rose
  two Wherries length from the place where it was let fall (being carried
  by the Current of the <i>Tide</i>) and when it rose within a yard or so
  of the same place where it was let down.</p>

  <p>The <i>other</i> Instrument, for Fetching up water from the depth of
  the sea, is (as appears by <i>Figure</i> 2.) a square woodden
  <i>Bucket</i> C, whose bottoms <i>EE</i>, are so contrived, that as the
  weight A, sinks the Iron B, (to which the Bucket C, is fastned by two
  handles DD, on the ends of which are the moveable bottoms or Valves EE,)
  and thereby draws down the Bucket, the resistance of the water keeps up
  the Bucket in the posture C; whereby the water hath, all the while it is
  descending, a clear passage through; whereas, as soon as the Bucket is
  pulled upwards by the Line F, the resistance of the water to that motion
  beats the Bucket downward, and keeps it in the posture G, whereby the
  Included water is preserved from getting out, and the Ambient water kept
  from getting in.</p>

  <p>By the advantage of which Vessel, it may be known, whether sea water
  be Salter at and towards the bottom, then at or near the top: Likewise,
  whether in some places of the sea, any sweet water is to be found at the
  bottom; the <i>Affirmative</i> whereof is to be met with in the <i>East
  Indian</i> Voyages of the industrious <i>John Hugh Van Linsckoten</i>,
  who page 16 of that Book, as 'tis <i>Englished</i>, records, that in the
  <i>Persian Gulph</i>, about the Island <i>Barem</i>, or <i>Baharem</i>,
  they fetch up with certain Vessels (which he describes not) water out of
  the sea, from under the salt-water, four or five fathom deep, as sweet,
  as any Fountain water. <!-- Page 150 --><span class="pagenum"><a

<h3><i>Of the Judgement of some of the </i>English<i> Astronomers,
touching the difference between two
learned men, about an Observation made of
the First of the two late </i>Comets<i>.</i></h3>

<div class="sidenoter"><i>By </i>Telescopical<i> Stars are understood such, as are not seen, but by the help of a Telescope.</i></div>
  <p>Whereas notice has been taken in <i>Num.</i> 6. of these
  <i>Transactions</i>, that there was some difference between those two
  deservedly celebrated Philosophers, <i>Monsieur Hevelius</i> and
  <i>Monsieur Auzout</i>, concerning an Observation, made by the former of
  them, on the <sup>8</sup>/<sub>18</sub> of <i>February</i> 1665. &amp;
  that thereupon some Eminent <i>English</i> Astronomers, considering the
  importance of the dispute, had undertaken the examination thereof; it
  will, 'tis conceived, not be unacceptable to such, as saw those Papers,
  to be informed, what has been done and discerned by them in that matter.
  They having therefore compared the Printed Writings of the two
  Dissenters, and withall consulted the observations made with
  <i>Telescopes</i> at home, by some of the most intelligent Astronomers
  amongst them, who have attentively observed the Position of that
  <i>Comet</i> to the <i>Telescopical</i> stars, that lay in its way; Do
  thereupon Joyntly conclude, that, whatever that Appearance was, which was
  seen near the <i>First Star</i> of <i>Aries</i>, by <i>Monsieur
  Hevelius</i> (the truth of whose relation concerning the same, they do in
  no wise question) the said <i>Comet</i> did not come neer that
  <i>Star</i> in the left <i>Ear</i> of <i>Aries</i>, where the said M.
  <i>Hevelius</i> supposes it to have passed, but took its course neer the
  <i>Bright Star</i> in its <i>Left Horn</i>, according to <i>Bayers</i>
  Tables. And since that the Observations of judicious both <i>French,
  Italian, &amp; Dutch</i> Astronomers (as many of them, as are come to the
  knowledge of the <i>English</i>) do in the main fully agree with theirs,
  they do not at all doubt, but that, there being such an unanimous <!--
  Page 151 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page151"></a>{151}</span>consent in what has been just now
  declared, &amp; the Controversie being about <i>Matter of fact</i>,
  wherein Authority, Number, and Reputation must cast the Ballance, Mons.
  <i>Hevelius</i>, who is as well known for his Ingenuity, as Learning,
  will joyn and acquiesce in that sentiment.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<h3><i>Of a correspondency, to be procured, for the Finding
out the </i>True<i> distance of the </i>Sun<i> and
</i>Moon<i> from the Earth, by the </i>Paralax<i>, observed
under (or neer) the same </i>Meridian<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>Seeing that the knowledge of this distance may prove of important Use,
  for the Perfecting of Astronomy, and for the better establishing the
  doctrine of <i>Refractions</i>, it is in the thoughts of some very
  curious Persons in <i>England</i>, for the finding out the same, to
  settle a Correspondency with some others abroad, that are understanding
  in Astronomical matters, and live in places farr distant in
  <i>Latitude</i>, and under (or near) the same <i>Meridian</i>.</p>

  <p>To perform which, the following Method is proposed to be observed;
  <i>viz.</i> That at certain times agreed on by two Observatours, making
  use of <i>Telescopes</i>, large, good and well fitted for this purpose,
  by a measuring rod, placed within the Eye glass at a convenient distance,
  that it may be distinctly seen, and serve for measuring small distances
  by minuts and seconds (which is easie enough in large <i>Telescopes</i>)
  that, I say, each of such observers, thus furnish't shall observe the
  visible way of the <i>Moon</i> among the <i>Fixt Stars</i>, (by taking
  her exact distance from any <i>Fixt Starr</i>, that lyes in or very near
  her way, together with the exact time of her so appearing) and the then
  apparent Diameter of her Disk; continuing these Observations every time
  for two or three hours; that so, <!-- Page 152 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page152"></a>{152}</span>if possible, two exact
  observations of her <i>Apparent</i> place among the <i>Fixt Stars</i>
  being made, at two places thus distant in <i>Latitude</i>, and as near as
  may be under the same <i>Meridian</i>, by these Observators concurring at
  the same time, her true and exact distance may be hence collected, not
  onely for that time, but at all other times, by any single Observator's
  viewing her with a <i>Telescope</i>, and measuring exactly her
  <i>Apparent</i> Diameter. It were likewise desirable, that as often as
  there happens any considerable <i>Eclipse</i> of the <i>Sun</i>, that
  this also might be observed by them, noting therein the exact measure of
  the greatest Obscuration compared with the then <i>Apparent</i> Diameter
  of his Disk. For by this means, after the distance of the <i>Moon</i>
  hath been exactly found, the distance of the <i>Sun</i> will easily be
  deduced.</p>

  <p>As for the time, fittest for making Observations of the <i>Moon</i>,
  that will be, when she is about a Quarter or somewhat less illuminated,
  because then her light is not so bright, but that with a good
  <i>Telescope</i> she may be observ'd to pass close by, and sometimes over
  several <i>Fixt Stars</i>; which is about four or five days before or
  after her Change: Or else at any other time, when the <i>Moon</i> passes
  near or over some of the bigger sort of <i>Fixt Stars</i>, such as of the
  first or second <i>Magnitude</i>; which may be easily calculated and
  foreseen: Or best of all, when there is any <i>Totall Eclipse</i> of the
  <i>Moon</i>; for then the smallest <i>Telescopical Stars</i> may be seen
  close adjoyning to the very body of the <i>Moon</i>. Of all which
  particulars the two Correspondents are to agree, as soon as he, that is
  to joyn abroad, shall be found out; whereupon they are mutually to
  communicate to each other, what they shall have thus observed in each
  place.</p>

  </div>
  <p>This Observation was made by Mr. <i>William Ball</i>, <!-- Page 153
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page153"></a>{153}</span>accompanied by
  his brother, Dr. <i>Ball</i>, <i>October</i> 13. 1665. at six of the
  Clock, at <i>Mainhead</i> near <i>Exeter</i> in <i>Devonshire</i>, with a
  very good <i>Telescope</i> near 38 foot long, and a double Eye-glass, as
  the observer himself takes notice, adding, that he never saw that
  <i>Planet</i> more distinct. The observation is represented by
  <i>Figure</i> 3. concerning which, the Author saith in his letter to a
  friend, as follows; This appear'd to me the present figure of
  <i>Saturn</i>, somewhat otherwise, than I expected, thinking it would
  have been decreasing, but I found it full as ever, and a little hollow
  above and below. Whereupon the Person, to whom notice was sent hereof,
  examining this shape, hath by Letters desired the worthy Author of the
  <i>Systeme of this Planet</i>, that he would now attentively consider the
  present <i>Figure</i> of his <i>Anses</i> or <i>Ring</i>, to see whether
  the appearance be to him, as in this <i>Figure</i>, and consequently
  whether he there meets with nothing, that may make him think, that it is
  not <i>one</i> body of a Circular Figure, that embraces his <i>Diske</i>,
  but <i>two</i>.</p>

  <p>And to the end that other Curious men, in other places might be
  engaged, to joyn their Observations with him, to see, whether they can
  find the like appearance to that, represented here, especially such
  Notches or Hollownesses, as at A and B, it was thought fit to insert here
  the newly related Account.</p>

<h3><i>A Relation of some </i>Mercurial<i> Observations,
and their Results.</i></h3>

  <p>Modern <i>Philosophers</i>, to avoyd Circumlocutions, call that
  Instrument, wherein a Cylinder of Quicksilver, of between 28. and 31.
  Inches in Altitude, is kept suspended after the manner of the
  <i>Torricellian</i> Experiment, a <i>Barometer</i> or <i>Baroscope</i>,
  first made publick by that Noble Searcher of Nature, Mr. <i>Boyle</i>,
  and imployed by Him and others, to detect all the minut variations in the
  Pressure and weight of the Air. For the more <!-- Page 154 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page154"></a>{154}</span>curious and nice
  distinguishing of which small changes, Mr. <i>Hook</i> in the
  <i>Preface</i> to his <i>Micrography</i>, has described such an
  Instrument with a <i>Wheel</i>, contrived by himself, and, by these two
  last years trials of it, constantly found most exact for that purpose:
  which being so accurate, and not difficult to be made, it were desirable,
  that those who have a Genius and opportunities of making Observations of
  this kind, would furnish themselves with such of these Instruments, as
  were exactly made and adjusted according to the Method, delivered in the
  newly mentioned place.</p>

  <p>To say something of the Observations, made by this Instrument, and
  withal to excite studious <i>Naturalists</i> to a sedulous prosecution of
  the same, the <i>Reader</i> may <i>first</i> take notice, that the lately
  named Mr. <i>Boyle</i> hath (as himself not long since did intimate to
  the Author of these <i>Tracts</i>) already made divers Observations of
  this kind in the year 1659. and 1660. before any others were publick, or
  by him so much as heard of; though he has hitherto forborn to divulge
  them, because of some other Papers (in whose Company they were to appear)
  which being hindred by other studies and employments, he hath not as yet
  finished.</p>

  <p><i>Next</i>, that, besides several others, who, since have had the
  curiosity of making such observations, the Worthy and Inquisitive Dr.
  <i>John Beal</i>, is doing his part with much assiduity (of which he hath
  by several Letters acquainted his Friends in <i>London</i>) both by
  observing himself, and by procuring many Correspondents in several places
  in <i>England</i> for the same purpose; judging it of great importance,
  that Observations of this kind be made in parts somewhat distant from one
  another, that so from many of those, accurately made and then compared,
  it may be discovered, whether the Aire gravitates more in the parts of
  the Earth lying more <i>East</i> or <i>West</i>, <i>North</i> or
  <i>South</i>? whether on such as lie neerer to the <i>Sea</i>, or further
  up into the <i>Mainland</i>? in hotter or colder weather? whether in <!--
  Page 155 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page155"></a>{155}</span>high
  Winds or Calms? whether in wet weather or dry? whether most when a North,
  or when a South, when an East or a West wind blows? and whether it keeps
  the same seasons of Changes? and whether the seasons and changes of the
  Air and Weather can be thereby discover'd, and the now hidden causes of
  many other <i>Phænomena</i> detected?</p>

  <p>The said <i>Doctor</i> is so much pleased with the discovery already
  made by the help of this Instrument, that he thinks it to be one of the
  most wonderful that ever was in the World, if we speak of strangeness,
  and just wonder, and of Philosophical importance, separate from the
  interest of lucre. For (<i>saith he in one of his Letters</i>) who could
  ever expect, that we men should find an Art, to weigh all the Air that
  hangs over our heads, in all the changes of it, and, as it were, to
  weigh, and to distinguish by weight, the Winds and the Clouds? Or, who
  did believe, that by palpable evidence we should be able to prove, the
  <i>serenest</i> Air to be most heavy, and the <i>thickest</i> Air, and
  when darkest Clouds hang neerest to us, ready to dissolve, or dropping,
  <i>then</i> to be lightest. And though (<i>so he goes on</i>) we cannot
  yet reach to all the Uses and Applications of it, yet we should be
  entertain'd for a while, by the truly Honourable Mr. <i>Boyle</i>, as the
  leading person herein, upon the delight and wonder. The <i>Magnet</i> was
  known many hundreds of years before it was applied to find out <i>New
  Worlds</i>. To me (<i>saith he</i>) tis a wonderful delight, that I have
  alwaies in my Study before my eye such a <i>Curious Ballance</i>.</p>

  <p>Having thus in <i>General</i> expressed his thoughts about this
  Invention, and the singular pleasure, he takes in the Observations made
  therewith, he descends to particulars, and in several Letters
  communicates them to his Correspondent, as follows:</p>

<div class="sidenoter"><i>The Exclusion of </i>all<i> Air is here necessary, because Air being subject to the operation of Heat and Cold, if any of it remain in the </i>Barometer<i>, it will cause it to vary from shewing the true Pressure of the Air.</i></div>
  <p>1. My <i>Wheel-barometer</i> I could never fill so exactly with
  <i>Mercury</i> as to exclude <i>all</i> Air; and therefore I trust more
  <!-- Page 156 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page156"></a>{156}</span>to a <i>Mercurial</i> Cane, and take all
  my Notes from it. This Cane is but 35. Inches long, of a very slender
  Cavity, and thick Glass. This may easily be conveyed to any place, for
  Trials. The Vessel for the stagnating <i>Mercury</i>, into which the said
  Cane is immersed, is about two <i>Inches</i> wide. The <i>Mercury</i> so
  well fill'd, that for some daies it would not subside, but hung to the
  top of the Glass-cane. I keep it in a Closet pretty close, 9. foot high,
  8. foot broad, 15. foot long; neer a Window. This I note, because
  possibly the closeness of the room may hinder, that it gives not the full
  of all Changes, as it might in a more passable Air.</p>

  <p>2. In all my Observations from <i>May</i> 28. 1664 to this present
  (<i>December</i> 9. 1665.) the Quicksilver never ascended but very little
  above 30¼ Inches.</p>

  <p>3. It ascended very seldom so high (<i>videl.</i> to 30¼ Inches)
  chiefly <i>Decemb.</i> 13. 1664. the weather being fickle-fair,
  Evening.</p>

  <p>4. I find by my <i>Calender</i> of <i>June</i> 22. 1664. at 5. in the
  Morning, in a time of long setled fair weather, that the <i>Mercury</i>
  had ascended about half an Inch higher then 30: but I fear some mistake,
  because I then took no impression of <i>wonder</i> at it; yet for 3. or
  4. daies, at that time it continued high, in well-setled, fair and warm
  weather; most part above 30. Inches. So that I may note, the
  <i>Mercury</i> to rise as high in the hottest <i>Summer</i>, as in the
  coldest <i>Winter-weather</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenoter"><i>Perhaps this is from some included Air.</i></div>
  <p>5. Yet surely I have noted it ascend a little higher for the Coldness
  of the Weather; and very frequently, both in <!-- Page 157 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page157"></a>{157}</span>Winter and Summer to be
  higher in the cold Mornings and Evenings, then in the warmer Mid-day.</p>

  <p>6. Generally in setled and fair weather both of Winter and Summer, the
  <i>Mercury</i> is higher, than a little <i>before</i> or <i>after</i>, or
  <i>in</i> Rainy weather.</p>

  <p>7. Again, generally it descended lower after Rain, than it was before
  Rain.</p>

<div class="sidenoter"><i>It seems these were </i>Easterly<i> winds.</i></div>
  <p>8. Generally also it falls in great winds; and somewhat it seem'd to
  sink, when I open'd a wide door to it, to let in stormy winds; yet I have
  found it to continue very high, in a long stormy wind of 3. or 4.
  daies.</p>

  <p>9. Again, generally it is higher in an <i>East</i> and
  <i>North</i>-wind. (<i>Cæteris paribus</i>) than in a <i>South</i> and
  <i>West</i>-wind.</p>

  <p>10. I tryed several times, by strong fumes and thick smoaks to alter
  the Air in my Closet; but I cannot affirm, that the <i>Mercury</i>
  yielded any more, then might be expected from some increase of heat. Such
  as have exact <i>Wheel-Barometers</i>, may try whether Odors or Fumes do
  alleviate the Air.</p>

  <p>11. In this Closet I have not in all this time found the extreamest
  changes of the Quicksilver to amount to more, than to 2¾, or to
  2&#x215E;. inches, at most.</p>

  <p>12. Very often I have found great changes in the Air, without any
  perceptible change in the <i>Barometer</i>; as in the dewy nights, when
  the moisture descends in a great quantity, and the thickness sometimes
  seems to hide the Stars from us: In the days foregoing, and following,
  the Vapors have been <!-- Page 158 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page158"></a>{158}</span>drawn up so <i>Invisibly</i>, that the Air
  and Sky seem'd very clear all day long. This I account a great change
  between ascending and descending Dews and Vapors (which import Levity and
  Weight,) and between thick Air and clear Air: which changes do sometimes
  continue in the Alternative course of day and night, for a week or
  fortnight together; and yet the <i>Baroscope</i> holding the same.</p>

  <p>13. Sometimes (I say not often) the <i>Baroscope</i> yields not to
  other very great changes of the Air. As lately (<i>December</i> 18.) an
  extraordinary bright and clear day; and the next following quite
  darkened, some Rain and Snow falling; but the <i>Mercury</i> the same: so
  in high winds and calms the same.</p>

  <p>14. I do conceive, that such as converse much <i>Sub dio</i>, and walk
  much abroad, may find many particulars much more exactly, then I, who
  have no leisure for it, can undertake. To instance in one of many,
  <i>December</i> 16. last, was a clear cold day, very sharp and strong
  <i>East</i> wind, the <i>Mercury</i> very near 30. inches high, about
  three in the afternoon, I saw a large black cloud, drawing near us from
  the <i>East</i> and <i>South-East</i>, with the <i>East-wind</i>. The
  <i>Mercury</i> changed not that day nor the day following; the Stars and
  most of the sky were very bright and clear till Nine of the Clock; and
  then suddenly all the sky was darkned, yet no change of weather happened;
  <i>December</i> 17. the frost held, and 'twas a clear day, till about two
  of the clock in the afternoon; and then many thick clouds appear'd low in
  the <i>West</i>; yet no change of the weather here; the Wind, Frost, and
  Quick-silver, the same, <i>December</i> 18. the <i>Mercury</i> fell
  almost ¼ of an inch, and the sky and Air so clear and bright and cold
  with an <i>East-wind</i>, that I wondred what could cause the
  <i>Mercury</i> to descend. I Expected, it should have ascended, as
  usually it does in such clear skys. Casually I sent my servant abroad,
  and he discovered the remote Hills, about 20. miles off, cover'd with
  <!-- Page 159 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page159"></a>{159}</span>snow, This seem'd to manifest, that the
  Air, being discharged of the clouds by snow, became lighter.</p>

  <p>15. I have seldom seen the change to be very great, at any one time.
  For, though I do not now take a deliberate view of my Notes, yet I
  wonder'd once to see, that in one day it subsided about ¾ of an inch.</p>

  <p>16. Of late I have altered my Method upon the <i>Barometer</i>,
  observing it, as it is before my Eyes, all day long, and much of the
  night, being watchful for the moments of every particular change, to
  examine, what cause in the Air and Heavens may appear for such changes.
  And now my wonder is, to see, how slow it is, it holding most between the
  nine and twentieth and thirtieth inch of late.</p>

  <p>17. I must now (<i>January</i> 13. 166<sup>5</sup>/<sub>6</sub>) tell
  you, that the <i>Mercury</i> stands at this time (as it did also
  yesterday) a quarter above 30. inches; yet both days very dark and
  cloudy, sometimes very thick and misty Air; which seldom falls out. For,
  for the most part, I see it higher in clearest setled weather, than in
  such cloudy and misty Foggs. This thick Air and darkness hath lasted
  above a week; lately more Cold, and <i>East</i> and <i>North-East</i>
  wind.</p>

<div class="sidenoter"><i>This seems to be wished, because the motion of the </i>Mercury<i> may be more free in a wider Cane.</i></div>
  <p><i>Thus far</i> the Notes of this Observing <i>Divine</i>; of which
  Mr. <i>Boyle</i>, to whom they were also communicated, entertains these
  thoughts, that they seem to him very faithfully made, and do for the
  main, agree well enough with his observations, as far as he remembers,
  not having them, it seems, at that time, when he wrote this, at hand; and
  though it be wished by him, that the Observer's Glass-Cane had been
  somewhat bigger; yet his diligence in fitting it so carefully, or rather
  so skilfully, as is above-mentioned, is much by him commended. <!-- Page

<h3><i>Some Observations of </i>Vipers<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>A curious <i>Italian</i>, called <i>Francesco Redi</i>, having lately
  had an opportunity, by the great number of Vipers, brought to the
  <i>Grand Duke</i> of <i>Toscany</i> for the composing of <i>Theriac</i>
  or <i>Treacle</i>, to examine what is vulgarly delivered and believed
  concerning the Poyson of those Creatures, hath, (according to the
  account, given of it in the French <i>Journal des Scavans</i>, printed
  <i>January</i> 4. 166<sup>5</sup>/<sub>6</sub>) performed his
  undertaking with much exactness, and published in an Italian tract, not
  yet come into <i>England</i>, these Observations.</p>

  <p>1. He hath observed, that the poyson of Vipers is neither in their
  <i>Teeth</i>, nor in their <i>Tayle</i>, nor in their <i>Gall</i>: but in
  the two <i>Vesicles</i> or <i>Bladders</i>, which cover their teeth, and
  which coming to be compressed, when the Vipers bite, do emit a certain
  yellowish Liquor, that runs along the teeth and poysons the wound.
  Whereof he gives this proof, that he hath rub'd the wounds of many
  Animals with the <i>Gall</i> of Vipers, and pricked them with their
  <i>Teeth</i>, and yet no considerable ill accident follow'd upon it, but
  that as often as he rubbed the wounds with the said yellow Liquor, not
  one of them escaped.</p>

  <p>2. Whereas commonly it hath hitherto been believed, that the poyson of
  Vipers being swallowed, was present death; this <i>Author</i>, after many
  reiterated Experiments, is said to have observed, that in Vipers there is
  neither Humour, nor Excrement, nor any part, not the <i>Gall</i> it self,
  that, being taken into the Body, kills. And he assures, that he hath seen
  men eat, and hath often made Bruit Animals swallow all that is esteem'd
  most poysonous in a Viper, yet without the least mischief to them. Whence
  he shews, that it needs not so much to be wondred at, that certain
  <i>Empiricks</i> swallow the juyce of the <!-- Page 161 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page161"></a>{161}</span>most venomous Animals
  without receiving any harm thereby; adding, that, which is ascribed to
  the vertue of their <i>Antidote</i>, ought to be attributed to the nature
  of those kinds of Poysons, which are no poysons, when they are swallow'd,
  (for which Doctrine he also alledges <i>Celsus</i>) but onely when they
  are put into wounds. Which also has been noted by <i>Lucan</i>, who
  introduces <i>Cato</i> thus speaking;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p><i>Noxia serpentum est admisto sanguine pestis,</i></p>
      <p><i></i>Morsu<i> virus habent, &amp; fatum </i>dente<i> minantur;</i></p>
      <p><i></i>Pocula<i> morte carent.</i></p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>And what also some Authors have affirm'd, <i>videl.</i> That it is
  mortal, to eat of the Flesh of creatures killed by Vipers; or to drink of
  the Wine wherein Vipers have been drowned; or to suck the wounds that
  have been made by them, is by this Authour observed to be wide of truth.
  For he assures, that many persons have eaten Pullets and Pigeons, bitten
  by Vipers, without finding any alteration from it in their health. On the
  contrary, he declares, That it is a soveraign Remedy against the biting
  of Vipers, to suck the wound; alledging an Experiment, made upon a Dog,
  which he caused to be bitten by a Viper at the nose, who by licking his
  own wound saved his life. Which he confirms by the example of those
  people, celebrated in <i>History</i> by the name of <i>Marsi</i> and
  <i>Psilli</i>, whose Employment it was, to heal those, that had been
  bitten by Serpents, by sucking their wounds.</p>

  <p>3. He adds, that although <i>Galen</i> and many modern
  <i>Physitians</i> do affirm, that there is nothing, which causeth so much
  thirst, as Vipers-flesh, yet he hath experimented the contrary and knows
  divers persons, who did eat the flesh of Vipers at all their meals, and
  yet did assure him, they never were less dry, then when they observed
  that kind of Diet.</p>

  <p>4. As for the Salt of Vipers, whereof some <i>Chymists</i> have <!--
  Page 162 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page162"></a>{162}</span>so
  great esteem, he saith, that it hath no <i>Purging</i> vertue at all in
  it; adding that even of <i>All Salts</i>, none hath more vertue than
  another, as he pretends to have shew'd in an other <i>Book</i> of his,
  <i>De natura salium</i>; which also hath not been yet transmitted into
  these parts.</p>

  <p>5. He denies, what <i>Aristotle</i> assures, and what <i>Galen</i>
  saith to have often tryed, that the <i>Spittle</i> of a <i>Fasting</i>
  person kills Vipers; and he laughs at many other particulars, that have
  been delivered concerning the <i>Antipathy</i> of Vipers unto certain
  things; and their manner of Conception and Generation, and several other
  properties, commonly ascribed to them; which the alledged French Author
  affirms to be refuted by so many experiments made by this <i>Italian</i>
  Philosopher, that it seems to him, there is no place left for doubting,
  after so authentick a testimony.</p>

<h3><i>Observations continued upon the </i>Barometer<i>, or rather </i>Ballance of
the Air<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>These <i>Transactions</i> being intended, <i>not only</i> to be (by
  parcels) brief Records of the Emergent Works and Productions in the
  Universe; Of the Mysteries of Nature of later discoveries; And, of the
  growth of Useful Inventions and Arts; <i>but</i> also, and chiefly, to
  sollicite in all parts mutuall Ayds and Collegiate endeavours for the
  farther advancement thereof: We shall begin this <i>Second</i> year of
  our Publications in this kind (in which, for 3-moneths the
  Printing-presses were interrrupted by the publick Calamity) with a few
  more particular Observations upon the <i>Ballance of the Air</i>, as they
  are most happily invented and directed by Mr. <i>Boyle</i>; and deserve
  to be prosecuted with care and diligence in all places.</p>

  <p>But it is to be premised, that the Worthy person, who was alledged as
  the Author of the Observations, delivered of this kind in the last of
  these <i>Tracts</i> (Dr. <i>Beale</i>) gives notice, That <!-- Page 164
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page164"></a>{164}</span>he did not
  pretend to exactness, but only to excite the carefulness of others in the
  several distant places, and chiefly such, as can have the assistance of a
  <i>Wheel-ballance</i> perfectly filled: without both which aids he hopes
  not to obtain all the benefits and mysteries of this Invention.</p>

  <p>This being thus briefly intimated, the Account of the Observations
  themselves, as they were extracted out of a late Letter of the same
  Person, are, as followes:</p>

  <p>1. As I have fitted and filled the <i>Single Cane</i>, I can say in
  the general, That I have not yet found any such infallible Prognostick of
  these changes of weather, which do follow a long serenity, or setled
  weather. And perchance in brighter Climats it may be constantly
  infallible. In these <i>Northern Islands</i>, the Clouds are so short,
  and narrow, and by fickle changes are sometimes emptied upon us,
  sometimes so neer, as may make so little variation in the weight of the
  whole Atmosphere of Air, as may sometimes deceive us, or smother and hide
  from us the <span class="sidenoter"><i></i>Hygroscopes<i> are
  Instruments, to discover the degrees of Moisture and Drought of the
  Air.</i></span> causes of fixedness, or of changes. I wish I could see a
  good <i>Calendar</i> or <i>Journal</i> taken in taken in <i>Tangier</i>,
  and in some of our <i>Northern</i> and most <i>Southern</i> parts of
  <i>America</i>. I have store of <i>Hygroscopes</i> of divers kinds; and I
  do remark them, and the sweatings of Marble, and as many other famed
  Prognosticks, as I can hear off; but can find nothing so neerly
  indicative of the change of weather, as this <i>Ballance</i>. Those
  others are often changed by Dews, which do not at all alter the
  <i>Ballance</i>, nor alter the state of the weather: And the open
  Weather-glass is known to signifie nothing at certainty, having a double
  obedience to two Masters, sometimes to the <i>Weight of the Air</i>,
  sometimes to <i>Heat</i>, as the service is commanded.</p>

  <p>2. And in further confirmation of this Note, I may adde to the former,
  That in <i>January</i> last 166<sup>5</sup>/<sub>6</sub>, from the
  <i>fourth</i>, and more especially from the <i>seventh</i> day, for many
  daies it continued very dark, so that all men expected daily great rain;
  yet the <i>Mercury</i> held very high, neer to the greatest height; And
  though in those daies sometimes thick mists arose, and some small rain
  fell, yet the <i>Quick-silver</i> held at a great height: which did
  indicate to me, there could <i>then</i> be no great change of weather. As
  the small rain fell, it yeilded somewhat, not much; and that does more
  <!-- Page 165 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page165"></a>{165}</span>confirm the indication. And more lately,
  in very dark daies, I had the same confidence upon the same ground, and I
  was not disappointed.</p>

  <p>3. Again, if the <i>Mercury</i> ascends to a good height after the
  fall of rain (as sometimes, but less often it does) then I look for a
  setled serenity; but if it proceeds after rain in a descending motion,
  then I expect a continuance of broken and showry weather. But in all, as
  I only say, <i>For the most part</i>, so I dare not positively declare it
  an affirmative result, but do refer it to the remarks of others. And this
  may explicate the Notes 6. and 14 of <i>Num.</i> 9. into more
  clearness.</p>

  <p>4. That we find the Weather and our Bodies more chill, cold, and
  drooping, when the <i>Mercury</i> is lowest, and the Air lightest,
  besides other causes, I guess, That as Air is to us the breath of life,
  as water is to Fishes; so, when we are deprived of the usual measure of
  this our food, 'tis the same to us, as when the water is drawn ebb from
  Fishes. But I would much rather be instructed by others, then offer much
  in this kind.</p>

  <p>5. The lowest descent of the <i>Mercury</i> in all the time, since I
  have observed it, was <i>Octob.</i> 26. 1665. in the Evening, when it was
  very near at 27½ Inches. Which I find thus circumstanced with the weather
  in my notes.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p><i>Oct.</i> 25. Morning; <i>Mercury</i> at 28½ Inch. Great storms and
  much rain.</p>

  <p><i>Oct.</i> 26. Morning; <i>Merc.</i> at 28. winds quiet, thick dark
  clouds.</p>

  <p><i>Oct.</i> 26. Evening; <i>Merc.</i> at 27½. That day, and some daies
  following, the weather was variable, frequent rain, and as you see, the
  <i>Mercury</i> lower, than usual.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>6. Over the place, where this <i>Mercurial Cane</i> stands, I have set
  a <i>Wind vane</i>, with purpose of exactness, of a Streamer in Brass so
  large, and pointing to a Board indented in the Margin, that I can at a
  sure Level upon the <i>Vane</i>, take every of the 32. points of the
  Wind, half points, and quarter points, at good distance. Otherwise we may
  find our guesses much deceived, as the best guessers, upon trial, do
  acknowledge. And this exactness may become the <i>Wheel-ballance</i>,
  which shews the minutest variations almost beyond imagination. And thus
  any servant, at the approach of a thick Cloud, or other <i>Meteor</i>,
  higher or lower, or at the rising of a storm or fresh wind in the night,
  or day, may bring a report of the Weight of the Air, as certainly and
  almost as <!-- Page 166 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page166"></a>{166}</span>easily, as of the Sun from the <i>Dial</i>
  in a Sunshine. It were good to have an <i>Index</i> of Winds, that
  discover'd as well their Ascent and Descent, as their Side-coastings.</p>

<h3><i>A Relation concerning the late </i>Earthquake<i> neer </i>Oxford<i>; together
with some Observations of the sealed Weatherglass, and the Barometer
both upon that </i>Phænomenon<i>, and in </i>General<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>This Relation was communicated by the excellently learned Dr.
  <i>Wallis</i>, as follows:</p>

  <p>On the 19. of <i>January</i> 1665. <i>Stylo Angliæ</i> (or <i>Jan.</i>
  29. 1666. <i>stylo novo</i>) at divers places neer <i>Oxford</i>, was
  observed a small <i>Earthquake</i> (as at <i>Blechington, Stanton-St.
  Johns, Bril</i>, &amp;c.) towards evening. In <i>Oxford</i> it self, I
  doe not hear, that it was observ'd to be an Earthquake; yet I remember
  about that time (whether precisely then or not; I cannot say) I took
  notice of some kind of odde shaking or heaving I observed in my study,
  but did impute it to the going of Carts or Coaches, supposed to be not
  far off; though yet I did take notice of it, as a little differing from
  what is usual on such occasions; (and wondered the more, that I did not
  hear any:) But not knowing, what else to refer it to, I thought no more
  of it. And the like account I have had from some others in <i>Oxford</i>,
  who yet did not think of an Earth-quake; it being a rare thing with us.
  Hearing afterwards of an Earthquake observed by others; I looked on my
  Notes concerning my <i>Thermoscope</i> and <i>Baroscope</i>, to see if
  any alteration considerable had then happened.</p>

  <p>My <i>Thermoscope</i> consists of a round large Glass, containing
  about half a pint or more; from whence issues a long Cylindrical neck of
  Glass, about two foot and a half in length, and less than a quarter of an
  inch diameter; which neck was <i>hermetically</i> sealed at the top, to
  exclude communication with the External Air; but before the sealing of
  it, the whole Glass was filled with <i>Spirit of Wine</i> (tinged with
  <i>Cochineel</i>, to make it the more discernable to the Eye) so warmed,
  that it filled the whole content of the Glass; but afterwards, as it
  cooled, did so subside, as to leave a void space in the upper part of the
  Neck. Which Instrument, so prepared, doth by the rising or falling of the
  tinged liquor in the neck (consequent upon the expanding or contracting
  of the whole liquor contained in it and the Ball below) give a very nice
  account of the Temperature of the Air, <!-- Page 167 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page167"></a>{167}</span>as to <i>Heat</i> or
  <i>Cold</i>: Even so nice, as that my being or not being in my Study I
  find to vary its hight sometimes almost a quarter of an inch.</p>

  <p>My <i>Baroscope</i>, I call another Instrument for estimating the
  <i>Weight</i> or <i>Pressure</i> of the Incumbent Air, consisting of a
  long <i>Glass-tube</i> of about 4. foot in length, and about a quarter of
  an inch Bore: which tube (<i>hermetically</i> sealed at the one end)
  being filled with Quicksilver (according to the <i>Torricellian</i>
  Experiment) is inverted, so as to have the open end of it immersed in
  Stagnant Quicksilver, contained in a larger Glass under it, exposed to
  the pressure of the outward Air: Out of which open end (after such
  immersion) the Quicksilver in the Tube being suffered to run out, as much
  as it will, into the Stagnant Quicksilver, in which that mouth or open
  end is immersed, there is wont to remain (as is commonly known to those
  acquainted with this Experiment) a Cylinder of Quicksilver suspended in
  the Tube, about 28, 29, or 30. inches high; measuring from the surface of
  the Stagnant Quicksilver perpendicularly; (but more or less, within such
  limits, according as the Weight or Pressure of the Air incumbent on the
  External Stagnant Quicksilver exposed to it, is greater or less:) leaving
  the upper part of the Tube void. (Both which Instruments being the
  contrivance of the Honourable <i>Robert Boyle</i>, they are by him more
  particularly described in his <i>Physico-Mechanical Experiments touching
  the Air, Exper.</i> 17. and 18. and in his <i>Thermometrical
  Discourses</i>, premised to his <i>History of Cold</i>.)</p>

  <p>Now, according to both these Instruments, having kept a daily
  <i>Register</i> of Observations for more than a whole year (saving when I
  have been for some short time absent from home) I find my Notes for that
  day to be these.</p>

  <p>So that, there being in the morning (<i>January</i> 19.) a hard frost
  (which began the day before about 4. of the Clock in the <!-- Page 168
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page168"></a>{168}</span>afternoon
  (<i>Jan.</i> 18.) and continued (with us) till about 5. of the Clock in
  the afternoon of that day, <i>Jan</i> 19. with some fierceness) and the
  weather, <i>Jan.</i> 19. being in the morning, close; and cloudy all the
  day, with little of Sun-shine; the Liquor in the <i>Thermoscope</i> was
  very little raised, by 4. of the Clock afternoon, that is, but
  <sup>5</sup>/<sub>16</sub> of an inch (which, had the Sun shone, would,
  it's likely, have been near an Inch:) and after that time (or somewhat
  before) had there been no considerable change of weather, it would upon
  the Sun's setting have fallen (and probably so it did, till about 5. of
  the Clock, though I took no Observation in the interim.) But, contrary to
  what would have been expected, it was at 9. of the Clock at night, higher
  by &#x215B; of an inch, than it had been at 4. occasioned by the change
  of weather, the Frost suddenly breaking, with us, between 5. and 6. of
  the Clock; about which time also it began to rain, and continued raining
  that Evening and good part of the Night. And the next morning I found the
  Liquor yet higher by half an inch, <i>vid.</i> 15¼ inches: (by reason of
  the Air that night being so much warmer, than it had been the day
  before;) whereas commonly it is considerably lower in the morning, than
  over night.</p>

  <p>As to the <i>Baroscope</i>, for the Weight or Pressure of the Air; I
  find, that for the 11, l2, 13, 14, 15, 16, and 17. dayes, the
  <i>Mercury</i> in the Tube, was (by the ballancing Pressure of the
  incumbent Air on the stagnant Quicksilver, exposed to it) kept up to the
  height of near 30. Inches above the surface of the External Quicksilver,
  (though with some little variation, as 30, 29<sup>15</sup>/<sub>16</sub>,
  29&#x215E;, 29<sup>13</sup>/<sub>16</sub> but never so low, all that
  time, as 29¾;) which is the greatest height I have know it at, (for I do
  not find that I have ever, till then, observed it to be, in my Glasses,
  full 30. Inches, though it have been very near it:) the Weather having
  been almost continually Foggy, or very thick Mists, all that time.
  <i>January</i> 18. it came down to 29¾, in the forenoon; and afternoon,
  to 29<sup>11</sup>/<sub>16</sub>. about the time the frost began: And
  <i>Jan.</i> 19. it was, at 8. in the morning, come down to 29½; at 4. in
  the afternoon, to 29¼. But at 9. in the evening (when the Earth quake had
  intervened) it was risen half an inch, <i>vid.</i> to 29¾. And, by the
  next morning, fallen again a whole inch, <i>vid.</i> to 28¾; which fall I
  attribute (at least in part) to the rain that fell in the night.</p>

  <p>This being what I observed out of my <i>Register</i> of these
  Instruments, (which, if I had then thought of an Earthquake, I <!-- Page
  169 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page169"></a>{169}</span>should
  have more nicely watched) what I have further gathered from Reports, is
  to this purpose.</p>

  <p>I hear, it was observed at <i>Blechington</i>, above 5. miles to the
  <i>North</i> of <i>Oxford</i>, and so along by <i>Bostol</i>,
  <i>Horton</i>, <i>Stanton-St. Johns</i>, and so towards <i>Whately</i>,
  which is about 4. miles <i>Eastward</i> from <i>Oxford</i>. Not at all
  these places at the same time, but moving forward from <i>Blechington</i>
  towards <i>Whately</i>. For it was at <i>Stanton</i> about 6. of the
  Clock or later (as I understand from Mr. <i>Boyle</i>, who was there at
  that time;) but had been at <i>Blechington</i> a good while sooner. And I
  am told, that it was taken notice of by Doctor <i>Holder</i> (a Member of
  our <i>Society</i>) who was then at <i>Blechington</i>, to be observed by
  those in the further part of the Garden, some very discernable time
  before it was observed by those in the House; creeping forward from the
  one place to the other. What other places in the Country it was observed
  at, I have not been informed: but at <i>Oxford</i> (which, it seems, was
  about the skirts of it) it was so small, as would have been hardly noted
  at all, had not the notice, taken of it abroad, informed us of it.</p>

  <p>Upon this Occasion, it will not be unseasonable to give some General
  accounts of what I have in my <i>Thermoscope</i> and <i>Baroscope</i>
  observed.</p>

  <p>My <i>Thermoscope</i>, being fitted somewhat at adventures, I have
  found at the lowest to be somewhat more than 12. inches high, in the
  fiercest time of the long Frost in the beginning of the last year 1665.
  and about 27. Inches high, at the highest, in the hottest time of the
  last Summer: (which I mention, that it may appear at what temperature in
  proportion, the Air was at the time above-mentioned.) But I must add
  withall, that this standing so, as never to be exposed to the Sun, but in
  a room, that has a window only to the North, it would have been raised
  much higher than 27. inches, if it were put in the hot Sun-shine in
  Summer; this, as it is placed, giving therefore an account onely of the
  Temperature of the Air in <i>general</i>, not of the immediate heat of
  the Sun-shine.</p>

  <p>This Instrument, thus situated, when it is about 15. inches, or lower,
  is for the most part hard frost; but seldom a frost, if higher than 16.
  Yet this I have often observed, that the Air by the <i>Thermoscope</i>
  has appeared considerably colder (and the liquor lower) at sometimes when
  there is no Frost, than at some other times, when the Frost hath been
  considerably hard. <!-- Page 170 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page170"></a>{170}</span></p>

  <p>In my <i>Baroscope</i>, I have never found the Quicksilver higher than
  30. inches, nor lower than 28. (at least, scarce discernably, not
  <sup>1</sup>/<sub>16</sub> of an inch higher than <i>that</i>, or lower
  than <i>this</i>;) which I mention, not only to shew the limits, within
  which I have observed mine to keep, <i>vid.</i> full 2 inches, but
  likewise as an Estimate of the Clearness of the Quicksilver from Air.
  For, though my Quicksilver were with good care cleansed from the Air; yet
  I find that which Mr. <i>Boyle</i> useth, much better: for, comparing his
  with mine at the same times, and both in <i>Oxford</i>, at no great
  distance; I find his Quicksilver to stand alwaies somewhat higher than
  mine (sometimes neer a quarter of an Inch;) which I know now how to give
  a more probable account off, than that my Quicksilver is either heavier
  than his; or else, that his is better cleansed from Air, (unless,
  possibly, the difference of the Bore, or other circumstances of the Tube,
  may cause the alteration; mine being a taller Tube, and a bigger Bore,
  than his.) And upon like reason, as his stands higher than mine; so
  another less cleansed from Air, may at the same time be considerably
  lower, and consequently under 28. Inches at the lowest.</p>

  <p>In <i>thick foggy</i> weather, I find my Quicksilver to rise; which I
  adscribe to the heaviness of the Vapours in the Air. And I have never
  found it higher, than in the foggy weather above-mentioned.</p>

  <p>In <i>Sunshiny</i> weather it riseth also (and commonly the clearer,
  the more;) which, I think, may be imputed <i>partly</i> to the Vapors
  raised by the Sun, and making the Air heavier; and <i>partly</i> to the
  Heat, increasing the Elastick or Springy power of the Air. Which latter I
  the rather add, because I have sometimes observed in Sunshiny weather,
  when there have come Clouds for some considerable time (suppose an hour
  or two) the Quicksilver has fallen; and then, upon the Suns breaking out
  again, it has risen as before.</p>

  <p>In <i>Rainy</i> weather, it useth to fall (of which the reason is
  obvious, because the Air is lightned, by so much as falls:) In
  <i>Snowy</i> weather, likewise, but not so much as in <i>Rain</i>. And
  sometimes I have observed it, upon a <i>Hoar-frost</i>, falling in the
  night.</p>

<div class="sidenoter">* <i>The Author of these Observations intends hereafter more particularly to observe, </i>from what points<i> those Winds blow, that make the Quicksilver thus subside.</i></div>
  <p>For <i>Windy</i> weather, I find it <i>generally</i> to fall; and that
  more universally, and more discernably, than upon Rain: (which I
  attribute to the Winds moving the Air <i>collaterally</i>, and thereby
  not suffering it to press so much <i>directly</i> downwards: the like of
  <!-- Page 171 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page171"></a>{171}</span>which we see in swimming, &amp;c.) And I
  have never found it lower than in high Winds.*</p>

  <p>I have divers times, upon discerning my Quicksilver to fall without
  any visible cause at home, looked abroad; and found (by the appearance of
  broken Clouds, or otherwise) that it had rained not far off, though not
  with us: Whereupon, the Air being then lightened, our heavier Air (where
  it rained not) may have, in part, discharged it self on that lighter.</p>

<h3><i>A more particular Account of those Observations about </i>Jupiter<i>, that
were mentioned in </i>Numb. 8<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>Since the publishing of <i>Numb.</i> 8. of these <i>Transactions</i>,
  where, among other particulars, some short Observations were set down
  touching both the <i>shadow</i> of one of <i>Jupiter's Satellits</i>,
  passing over his Body, and that <i>Permanent Spot</i>, which manifests
  the Conversion of that Planet about his own <i>Axis</i>; there is come to
  hand an <i>Extract</i> of that Letter, which was written from
  <i>Rome</i>, about those Discoveries, containing an ample and particular
  Relation of them, as they were made by the Learned <i>Cassini</i>,
  Professor of <i>Astronomy</i> in the University of <i>Bononia</i>. That
  <i>Extract</i>, as it is found in the <i>French Journal des Scavans</i>
  of <i>Febr.</i> 22. 1666. we thus <i>English</i>.</p>

  <p>Monsieur <i>Cassini</i>, after he had discovered (by the means of
  those Excellent Glasses of 50. <i>palmes</i>, or 35. <i>feet</i>, made by
  M. <i>Campani</i>) the <i>Shadows</i>, cast by the 4 Moons or
  <i>Satellits</i> of <i>Jupiter</i> upon his Diske, when they happen to be
  between the Sun and Him; after he had also distinguished their Bodies
  <i>upon</i> the Diske of <i>Jupiter</i>; made the last year some
  Prædictions for the Months of <i>August</i> and <i>September</i>, noting
  the dayes and hours, when the Bodies of the said <i>satellits</i> and
  their <i>Shadows</i> should appear upon <i>Jupiter</i>, to the end that
  the Curious might be convinced of this matter by their own
  Observations.</p>

  <p>Some of these Prædictions have been verified not only at <i>Rome</i>,
  and in other places of <i>Italy</i>, but also at <i>Paris</i> by M.
  <i>Auzout</i>, the most Celebrated and the most Exact of our
  <i>Astronomers</i>; and in <i>Holland</i>, by M. <i>Hugens</i>. And we
  can now doubt no longer, of the rotation of the <i>Satellits</i> about
  <i>Jupiter</i>, as the Moon turns about the Earth; nor believe, that
  <i>Jupiter</i> or his <i>Attendants</i> have any other Light, than that,
  which they receive from the Sun; as some did <!-- Page 172 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page172"></a>{172}</span>assure before these
  Observations. There remained to find by Experience, whether
  <i>Jupiter</i> did turn about his <i>Axis</i>, as many believe, that the
  <i>Earth</i> turns about her's. And although most <i>Astronomers</i> had
  conjectur'd, it did so, either by this Analogy, or by other Congruities,
  yet it was much wish'd, that we might be assured thereof by Observations.
  And this it is, for which we are obliged to M. <i>Cassini</i>, who,
  having by the advantage of the same Glasses discover'd several changes,
  as well in the three obscure <i>Belts</i>, commonly seen in
  <i>Jupiter</i>, as in the rest of his <i>Diske</i>, and having also
  observed Spots in the midst of that <i>Planet</i>, and sometimes
  <i>Brightnesses</i>, such as have bin formerly seen in the <i>Sun</i>,
  hath at length discover'd a <i>Permanent Spot</i> in the <i>Northern</i>
  part of the most <i>Southern</i> Belt; by the means whereof, he hath
  concluded, that <i>Jupiter</i> turns about his <i>Axis</i> in 9. <span
  class="correction" title="Original reads `dayes', which contradicts the rest of the paragraph."
  >hours</span>, 56. minutes, and makes 29. whole circumvolutions in 12
  dayes 4. minutes of ours, and 360 in 149. dayes. For he has found, that
  this <i>Spot</i> was not caused by the Shadow of any <i>Satellit</i>, as
  well by reason of its Situation, as because it appeared, when there could
  be no Shadow. Besides, that its motion differed from that of the Shadows,
  which is almost equal, as well towards the Edges as towards the Middle of
  <i>Jupiter</i>: Whereas, on the contrary, this <i>Spot</i> hath all the
  accidents, that must happen to a thing, which is upon the surface of a
  round Body moving; for example, to move much more slowly towards the
  Edges, than towards the Middle, and to pass over that part, which is in
  the middle of the Diske, equal to the half of the <i>Diameter</i>, in the
  sixth part of the time, it takes to make the whole revolution: he having
  seen this half pass'd over, in 99 or 100 minutes just, as it must happen,
  supposing the whole circumrotation is made in 9. hours 56. minutes.</p>

  <p>He hath not yet been able to determine the Situation of the
  <i>Axis</i>, upon which this motion is made, because the <i>Belts</i>,
  according to which it is made, have for some years appeared streight,
  though in the precedent years, other <i>Astronomers</i> have seen them a
  little crooked: Which sheweth, that the <i>Axis</i> of the diurnal motion
  of <i>Jupiter</i> is a little inclined to the plain of the
  <i>Ecliptick</i>. But in time we may discover, what certainty there is in
  this matter.</p>

<div class="sidenoter"><i>These </i>Tables<i> are not yet sent over, but, 'tis hoped, will be, ere long.</i></div>
  <p>After this excellent Discovery, he hath calculated many <i>Tables</i>,
  whereof he gives the Explication and Use in the Letters by him addressed
  to the Abbot <i>Falconieri</i>. By the means of them, one may know,
  <i>when</i> this <i>Spot</i> may be seen by us. For, having first <!--
  Page 173 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page173"></a>{173}</span>considered it in relation to the
  <i>Sun</i>, in respect whereof, its motion is regular, he considers the
  same in relation to the <i>Earth</i>, where <i>We</i> observe it; and
  shews by the means of his <i>Tables</i>, what is to be added or
  subtracted, to know, at what time the said <i>Spot</i> is to come into
  the middle of <i>Jupiter</i>'s Diske, according as he is Oriental or
  Occidental. He hath also considered it in relation to an unmovable point,
  which he has supposed to be the first point of <i>Aries</i>, because we
  thither refer here upon Earth the beginning of all the Celestial motions,
  and <i>there</i> is the <i>Primum mobile</i>, that one would imagine, if
  we were in <i>Jupiter</i>, as we do here imagine Ours of 24. hours.</p>

  <p>The Discovery is one of the best, that have been yet made in the
  Heavens; and those, that hold the Motion of the earth, find in it a full
  Analogy. For, <i>Jupiter</i> turning about the Sun, does nevertheless
  turn about his <i>Axis</i>; and although he be much bigger than the
  Earth, he does nevertheless turn much more swiftly than it, since he
  makes more than two Turns, and a third part, for its one; and carries
  with him 4. Moons, as the Earth does one.</p>

  <p>This Observation ought to excite all Curious persons to endeavour the
  perfecting of <i>Optick Glasses</i>, to the end that it may be
  discovered, whether the other <i>Planets</i>, as <i>Mars</i>,
  <i>Venus</i> and <i>Mercury</i>, about whom no Moon hath as yet been
  discovered, do yet turn about their <i>Axes</i>, and in how much time
  they do so; especially <i>Mars</i>, in whom some <i>Spot</i> is
  discover'd, and <i>Venus</i>, wherein M.<i>Burattini</i> hath signified
  from <i>Poland</i>, he has observ'd Inequalities, as in the Moon.</p>

  <p>It will be worth while, to watch for the seeing of <i>Jupiter</i>
  again this Spring, that this happy Observation may be confirmed in divers
  places, and endeavours used to make new ones.</p>

<h3><i>An Account of some Books, lately published.</i></h3>

  <p>I. <i>Hydrostatical Paradoxes, made out by New Experiments (for the
  most part Physical, and Easie) by the Honourable Robert Boyle.</i> This
  Treatise, promised in <i>Numb.</i> 8. of these Papers, is now come forth:
  And was occasioned by the perusal of the Learned Monsieur
  <i>Paschalls</i> Tract, <i>Of the Æquilibrium of Liquors</i>, and of the
  <i>Weight of the Air</i>: Of which two Subjects, the <i>latter</i> having
  been more clearly made out in <i>England</i> by Experiments, which could
  not be made by Monsieur <i>Paschal</i> and others, that wanted the
  advantage of such Engines and Instruments, as have here been frequently
  made use <!-- Page 174 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page174"></a>{174}</span>off; Our Noble Author insists most upon
  giving us his thoughts of the former, <i>videl.</i> the <i>Æquilibrium of
  Liquors</i>: Which Discourse consisting partly of <i>Conclusions</i>, and
  partly of <i>Experiments</i>, the <i>former</i> seem to Him to be almost
  all of them consonant to the Principles and Laws of the
  <i>Hydrostaticks</i>; but as for the <i>latter</i>, the Experimental
  proofs, offered by M. <i>Paschall</i> for his Opinions, are by our Author
  esteemed such, that he confesses, he hath no mind to make use of them:
  for which he alledges more reasons than one; which, doubtless, will
  appear very satisfactory to Intelligent <i>Readers</i>.</p>

  <p>Wherefore, instead of the those <i>Paschalian</i> Experiments, there
  is in this <i>Treatise</i> deliver'd a far more Expeditious way, to make
  out, <i>not only</i> most of the <i>Conclusions</i>, agreed on these two
  Authors, <i>but</i> others also, that M <i>Paschall</i> mentions not: and
  that with so much more ease and clearness, that persons, but ordinarily
  versed in the common principles of <i>Hydrostaticks</i>, may readily
  apprehend, what is deliver'd, if they will but bring with them a due
  Attention, and Minds disposed to prefer Reason and Experience to Vulgar
  opinions and Authors.</p>

  <p>It not being our <i>Authors</i> present Task, to deliver a Body of
  <i>Hydrostaticks</i>, but only some <i>Paradoxes</i>, which he conceives
  to be proveable by his New way of making them out, he delivers them in as
  many distinct Propositions; after each of which, he endeavours, in a
  Proof, or an Explication, to show, both that it is true, and why it ought
  to be so.</p>

  <p>The <i>Paradoxes</i> themselves (after a premised <i>Postulatum</i>)
  are these:</p>

  <p>1. That in Water, and other Fluids, the Lower parts are pressed by the
  Upper.</p>

  <p>2. That a lighter Fluid may gravitate or weigh upon a heavier.</p>

  <p>3. That, if a Body, contiguous to the Water, be altogether, or in
  part, lower than the highest level of the said Water, the lower part of
  the Body will be pressed upward by the Water, that touches it
  beneath.</p>

  <p>4. That in the Ascension of Water in Pumps, &amp;c. there needs
  nothing to raise the Water, but a Competent weight of an External
  Fluid.</p>

  <p>5. That the pressure of an External Fluid is able to keep an
  Heterogeneous Liquor suspended at the same height in several Pipes,
  though these Pipes be of very different Diameters.</p>

<p><!-- Page 175 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page175"></a>{175}</span></p>

  <p>6. If a Body be placed under Water, with its uppermost Surface
  parallel to the Horizon; how much Water soever there may be on this or
  that side above the Body, the direct pressure susteined by the Body (for
  we now consider not the Lateral nor the Recoyling pressure, to which the
  Body may be exposed, if quite environed with Water) is no more, than that
  of a Column of water, having Horizontal Superficies of the Body for its
  Basis, and the Perpendicular depth of the Water for its height.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>And so likewise,</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>If the Water, that leans upon the Body, be contained in Pipes open at
  both ends, the pressure of the Water is to be estimated by the weight of
  a pillar of Water, whose Basis is equal to the lower Orifice of the Pipe
  (which we suppose to be parallel to the Horizon) and its height equal to
  a perpendicular, reaching thence to the top of the Water; though the Pipe
  be much inclined towards the Horizon, or though it be irregularly shap'd,
  and much broader in some parts, than the said Orifice.</p>

  <p>7. That a Body, immersed in a Fluid, sustains a Lateral pressure from
  the Fluid; and that increased, as the depth of the immersed Body, beneath
  the Surface of the Fluid, increaseth.</p>

  <p>8. That Water may be made as well to depress a Body lighter than it
  self, as to buoy it up.</p>

  <p>9. That, whatever is said of Positive Levity, a parcel of Oyl lighter
  than Water, may be kept in Water without ascending in it.</p>

  <p>10. That the cause of the Ascension of Water in Syphons, and of its
  flowing through them, may be explicated without having a recourse to
  Nature's abhorrency of a <i>Vacuum</i>.</p>

  <p>11. That a Solid Body, as ponderous as any yet known, though near the
  Top of the water it will sink by its own weight; yet if it be placed at a
  greater depth, than that of twenty times its own thickness; it will not
  sink, if its descent be not assisted by the weight of the incumbent
  Water.</p>

  <p>These are the <i>Paradoxes</i>, evinced by our Authour with much
  evidence and exactness, and very likely to invite Ingenious men to
  cultivate and to make further disquisitions in so excellent a part of
  Philosophy, as are the <i>Hydrostaticks</i>; and Art deserving great
  <i>Elogiums</i>, not only, upon the account of the <i>Theorems</i> and
  <i>Problems</i>, which are most of them pure and handsome productions of
  Reason, very delightful and divers of them surprising, and besides, much
  conducing to the clear explication and <!-- Page 176 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page176"></a>{176}</span>thorow-understanding of
  many both familiar and abstruse <i>Phænomena</i> of Nature; but also,
  upon the score of its <i>Practical</i> use, since the Propositions, it
  teaches, may be of great importance to Navigation, and to those that
  inquire into the Magnitudes and Gravities of Bodies, as also to them,
  that deal in Salt-works: Besides, that the <i>Hydrostaticks</i> may be
  made divers waies serviceable to <i>Chymists</i>, as the Author
  intimates, and intends to make manifest, upon several occasions, in his
  yet unpublisht part of the <i>Usefulness of Natural and Experimental
  Philosophy</i>.</p>

  <p>These Propositions are shut up by two important <i>Appendixes</i>,
  whereof the <i>one</i> contains an Answer to seven Objections by a late
  learned Writer, to evince, that the upper parts of water press not upon
  the lower; the <i>other</i>, solves that difficult <i>problem</i>, why
  <i>Urinators</i> or <i>Divers</i>, and others, who descend to the bottom
  of the Sea, are not oppressed with the weight of the incumbent water?
  where, among other solutions, <i>that</i> is examined, which occurs in a
  printed Letter of Monsieur <i>des Cartes</i>, but is found
  unsatisfactory.</p>

  <p>II. <i>Nicolai Stenonis de Musculis &amp; Glandulis Observationum
  Specimen; cum duabus Epistolis Anatomicis</i>. In the <i>Specimen</i> it
  self, the Author, having described in <i>general</i>, both the
  <i>Structure</i> and the <i>Function</i> of the <i>Muscles</i>, applies
  that description to the <i>Heart</i>, to demonstrate that <i>that</i> is
  also a <i>true Muscle</i>: Observing <i>first</i>, that in the substance
  of the <i>Heart</i> there appears nothing but <i>Arteries, Veins, Nerves,
  Fibres, Membrans</i>; and that that, &amp; nothing else is found in a
  <i>Muscle</i>; affirming withall, that which is commonly taught of the
  <i>Muscles</i>, and particularly of the <i>Heart's Parenchyma</i>, as
  distinct from <i>Fibres</i>, is due, not to the <i>Senses</i>, but the
  <i>Wit</i> of <i>Anatomists</i>: so that he will not have the
  <i>Heart</i> made up of a substance peculiar to it self, nor considered
  as the principle of <i>Innate heat</i>, or of <i>Sanguification</i>, or
  of <i>vital spirits</i>. He observes <i>next</i>, that the <i>Heart</i>
  performs the like <i>operation</i> with the <i>Muscles</i>, to wit, to
  contract the Flesh; which action how it can have a different cause from
  that of the Contraction made in the <i>Muscles</i>, where there is so
  great a parity and agreement in the <i>Vessels</i>, he sees not. And as
  for the <i>Phænomena</i>, that occur, of the <i>Motion</i> of the Heart,
  he undertakes to explicate them all, from the <i>Ductus</i> or
  <i>Position</i> of the <i>Fibres</i>; but refers for the performance of
  this undertaking to another <i>Treatise</i>, he intends to publish.</p>

<div class="sidenoter"><i></i>Conglobate<i> Glanduls are called those, that do consist, as it were, of one continued substance, having an </i>even<i> superficies; whereof there are many in the </i>Mesentery<i>, and in other places: contra distinguisht to those, that bear the name of </i>Conglomerate<i> Glanduls, which are made up of several small Kernels, such as the </i>Pancreas<i>, the </i>Salivating Glanduls<i>, &amp;c.</i></div>
  <p>As to his Observations about <i>Glanduls</i>, he affirms, that he has
  been the First, that has discover'd that Vessel, which by him is call'd
  <!-- Page 177 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page177"></a>{177}</span><i>Salivare Exterius</i>, passing from the
  <i>Parotides</i> (or the two chief Arteries that are on the right and
  left side neer the Throat) into the Mouth, and conveying the
  <i>Spittle</i>: Where he also gives an account of several other Vessels
  and Glanduls, some about the <i>Lips</i>; others under the <i>Tongue</i>;
  others in the <i>Pallate</i> &amp;c. To which he adds the Vessels of the
  <i>Eye-lids</i>, which have their root in the <i>Glanduls</i> that are
  about the Eyes, and serve for the <i>shedding of Tears</i>. He mentions
  also several things about the <i>Lymphatick vessels</i>, and is of
  opinion, that the knowledge thereof may be much illustrated by that kind
  of <i>Glanduls</i> that are called <i>Conglobatæ</i>, and by their
  <i>true</i> insertion into the veins; the mistake of the latter whereof,
  he conceives to have very much misled the Noble <i>Ludovicus de
  Bills</i>, notwithstanding his excellent method of <i>dissection</i>. And
  here he observes <i>first</i>, that all the <i>Lymphatick vessels</i>
  have such a commerce with the <i>Glanduls</i>, that none of them is found
  in the body, which either has not its origine <i>from</i>, or is inserted
  <i>into</i> a <i>Glandule</i>: And <i>then</i>, that <i>Glanduls</i> are
  a kind of <i>Strainers</i>, so form'd, that whilst the Blood passes out
  of the Arteries into the Veins through the small <i>Capillary</i>
  vessels, the <i>Serous</i> parts thereof, being freed from the
  <i>Sanguineous</i>, are by vertue of the beat expell'd through fit pores
  into the <i>Capilaries</i> of the <i>Lymphaticks</i>, the direction of
  the <i>Nerves</i> concurring.</p>

  <p>Of the two annex'd <i>Epistles</i>, the <i>First</i> gives an account
  of the dissection of two <i>Raja's</i> or <i>Skates</i>, and relates that
  the Author found in the bellies of these Fishes a <i>Haddock</i> of 1½
  span long, and a <i>Sole</i>, a <i>Plaise</i>, and nine middle-sized
  <i>Sea crafishes</i>; whereof not only the three former had their flesh,
  in the fishes stomack, turn'd into a <i>fluid</i>, and the Gristles or
  Bones into a <i>soft</i> substance, but the <i>Crafishes</i> had their
  shels comminuted into very small particles, tinging here and there the
  <i>Chyle</i> near the <i>Pylorus</i>; which he judges to be done not so
  much by the heat of the Fishes stomack, as by the help of some digesting
  juyce. Coming to the <i>Uterus</i> of these Fishes, he takes occasion to
  examine, with what ground several famous <i>Naturalists</i> and
  <i>Anatomists</i> have affirm'd, that Eggs are the <i>uterus</i> exposed
  or ejected out of the body of the Animal. Taking a view of their
  <i>Heart</i>, he there finds but <i>one</i> ventricle, and discourses of
  the difficulty arising from thence. As for the <i>Lungs</i>, he saw no
  clearer footsteps of them in these, than he had done in other Fishes: but
  within the mouth he trac'd several <i>gaping fissures</i>, and found the
  recesses of the <i>Gills</i> so form'd, that the water taken in at the
  mouth, being let out by these dores, cannot by them re-enter, by reason
  of a skin outwardly passing over every hole, and covering it. Where he
  intimates, that though Fishes have not <i>true</i> Lungs, yet they want
  not a <i>Succedaneum</i> thereto, to wit, the <i>Gills</i>; and if
  <i>water</i> may be to Fishes, what <i>Air</i> is to terrestrial Animals,
  for Respiration: affecting, that whereas nothing is so necessary for the
  conservation of Animal life as a reciprocal Access and Recess of the
  <i>Ambient</i> to the sanguineous vessels, tis all one, whether that be
  done by receiving the Ambient <i>within</i> the body, or by its gentle
  passing <i>by</i> the <i>Prominent</i> vessels of the <i>Gills</i>.</p>

  <p>The other <i>Epistle</i>, contains some Ingenious Observations,
  touching the way, by which the Chicken, yet in the shell, is nourish't,
  <i>videl.</i> not by the conveyance of the <i>Yolk</i> into the
  <i>Liver</i> by the <i>Umbilical</i> vessels, nor into the <i>Stomack</i>
  by the <!-- Page 178 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page178"></a>{178}</span><i>Mouth</i>, but by a Peculiar
  <i>ductus</i>, by him described, into the <i>Intestins</i>, where,
  according to his alledged experience, it is turn'd into <i>Chyle</i>:
  which he affirms, he hath discover'd, by taking an Egge from under a
  brooding Hen, when the Chicken was ready to break forth, and when he was
  looking for the passage of the <i>Yolk</i>, out of its integument into
  the <i>Liver</i>, by finding it pass thence into the <i>Intestins</i>, as
  he found the <i>White</i> to do by the <i>mouth</i> into the
  <i>belly</i>. Whence he inclines to infer, that, since every <i>fætus</i>
  takes in at the mouth the liquor it swims in, and since the Chicken
  receives the <i>white</i> of the Egge into the <i>mouth</i>, and the
  <i>yolk</i> by the new discover'd <i>ductus</i> into the
  <i>Intestins</i>, it cannot be certainly made out, that a <i>part</i> of
  the <i>Chyle</i> is conveyed into the <i>Liver</i>, before it passes into
  the <i>Heart</i>; Exhorting in the mean time the <i>Patrons</i> of the
  <i>Liver</i>, that they would produce Experiments to evince their
  Ratiocinations.</p>

  <p>III. <i>Regneri de Graeff, de Succi Pancreatici Natura &amp; usu,
  Exercitatio Anatomico-medica.</i> In this Tract, the Industrious Author,
  after he has enumerated the various opinions of <i>Anatomists</i>
  concerning the use of that kernelly substance; call'd <i>Pancreas</i> (in
  <i>English</i>, the <i>Sweetbred</i>) endeavours to prove experimentally
  that this <i>Glandule</i> was not form'd by Nature, to separate any
  <i>Excrementitious</i> humor, and to convey it into the <i>Intestins</i>,
  but to prepare an <i>useful</i> juyce out of the Blood and Animal
  Spirits, of a somewhat <i>Acid</i> taste, and to carry the same into the
  Gut, call'd <i>Duodenum</i>, to be there mixt with the Aliment, that has
  been in some degree already fermented in the Stomack, for a further
  fermentation, to be produced by the conflux of the said acid
  <i>Pancreatick</i> juyce and some <i>Bilious</i> matter, abounding with
  volatile Salt, causing an Effervescence; which done, that juyce is,
  together with the purer part of the nourishment, carried into the
  <i>Milkie</i> veins, thence into the <i>common receptacle</i> of the
  <i>Chyle</i> and <i>Lymphatick liquor</i>, and so through the <i>ductus
  Thoracicus</i> into the right Ventricle of the Heart.</p>

  <p>This Assertion, first advanced (saith the <i>Author</i>) partly by
  <i>Gothofredus Mobius</i>, partly by <i>Franciscus de le Boe Sylvius</i>,
  he undertakes to prove by experiments; which, indeed, he has with much
  industry, tried upon several Animals, to the end that he might collect
  some of this juyce of the <i>Pancreas</i> for a taste: which having at
  last obtained, and found it somewhat <i>acid</i>, he thereupon proceeds
  to deliver his opinion both of the <i>constitution</i> and quantity of
  this <i>Succus</i> in <i>healthy</i> Animals, and the vices thereof, in
  the <i>unhealthy</i>: deriving most diseases <i>partly</i> from its too
  great Acidity, or from its saltness, or harshness; <i>partly</i> from its
  paucity or redundancy: but especially, endeavouring to reduce from
  thence, as all <i>intermittent Feavers</i> (of all the <i>Phænomena</i>
  whereof he ventures to assign the causes from this <i>Hypothesis</i>) so
  also the <i>Gout, Syncope's, Stranguries, Oppilations, Diarrhæas,
  Dysenteries, Hysterical</i> and <i>Colick passions</i>, &amp;c. All which
  he concludes with mentioning the waies and remedies to cure the manifold
  peccancy of this juyce by Evacuations and Alterations.</p>

  <p>This seeming to be a <i>new</i> as well as a <i>considerable</i>
  discovery, it is hop'd, that others will by this intimation be invited to
  prosecute the same by further experiments, either to confirm what this
  Author has started, if true, or to rectifie it, if he be mistaken.</p>

<h3><i>A Confirmation of the former Account touching the late </i>Earth-quake<i>
near </i>Oxford<i>, and the Concomitants thereof.</i></h3>

  <p>This Confirmation came from the Noble Mr. <i>Boyle</i> in a Letter, to
  the <i>Publisher</i>, as followeth:</p>

  <p>As to the <i>Earth-quake</i>, your curiosity about it makes me sorry,
  that, though I think, I was the first, that gave notice of it to several
  of the <i>Virtuosi</i> at <i>Oxford</i>; yet the Account, that I can send
  you about it, is not so much of the <i>Thing</i> it self, <!-- Page 180
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page180"></a>{180}</span>as of the
  <i>Changes of the Air</i>, that accompanied it. To inform you of which, I
  must relate to you, that riding one Evening somewhat late betwixt
  <i>Oxford</i> &amp; a Lodging, I have at a place, 4 miles distant from
  it, the weather having been for a pretty while Frosty, I found the Wind
  so very cold, that it reduced me to put on some defensives against it,
  which I never since, nor, if I forget not, all the foregoing part of the
  Winter was obliged to make use off. My unwillingness to stay long in so
  troublesome a Cold, which continued very piercing, till I had got half
  way home-ward, did put me upon galloping at no very lasy rate; and yet,
  before I could get to my Lodgings, I found the Wind turned, and felt the
  Rain falling; which, considering the shortness of the time, and that this
  Accident was preceded by a setled Frost, was surprising to me, and
  induced me to mention it at my return, as one of the greatest and
  suddainest Alterations of Air, I have ever observ'd: And what changes I
  <span class="sidenoter">* <i>See</i> Num. 10. Phil. Transactions p. <a
  href="#page166">166</a>-<a href="#page171">171</a>; <i>at the time of the
  printing whereof, this Relation of Mr.</i> Boyle <i>was not yet come to
  hand.</i></span> found, have been taken notice of in the <i>Gravity</i>
  of the <i>Atmosphere</i> at the same time by that Accurate Observer * Dr.
  <i>Wallis</i>, who then suspected nothing of what follow'd; as I suppose,
  he has ere this told you himself. Soon after, by my guess about an hour,
  there was a manifest <i>Trembling</i> in the House where I was (which
  stands high in comparison of <i>Oxford</i>.) But it was not there so
  great, but that I, who chanced to have my thoughts busied enough on other
  matters, than the weather, should not have taken notice of it as an
  <i>Earth-quake</i>, but have imputed it to some other cause, if one, that
  you know, whose hand is employed in this Paper, and begins to be a
  diligent observer of Natural things, had not advertis'd me of it; as
  being taken notice of by him and the rest of the people of the House. And
  soon after there hapned a brisk Storm: whereupon I sent to make inquiry
  at a place call'd <i>Brill</i>, which standing upon a much higher ground,
  I supposed might be more obnoxious to the effects of the
  <i>Earth-quake</i> (of which, had I had any suspition of it, my having
  formerly been in one neer the <i>Lacus Lemanus</i>, would have made me
  the more observant:) But the person I sent to, being <!-- Page 181
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page181"></a>{181}</span>disabled by
  sickness to come over to me (which he promis'd to do, as soon as he
  could) writ me only a <i>Ticket</i>, whose substance was, That the
  <i>Earth-quake</i> was there much more considerable, than where I lodged,
  and that at a Gentlemans house, whom he names (the most noted Person, it
  seems, of the neighbourhood) the House trembled very much, so as to make
  the Stones manifestly to move to and fro in the Parlour, to the great
  amazement and fright of all the Family. The Hill, whereon this
  <i>Brill</i> stands, I have observ'd to be very well stor'd with Mineral
  substances of several kinds; and from thence I have been inform'd by
  others, that this Earth-quake reach'd a good many miles; but I have
  neither leasure, nor inclination to entertain you with uncertain reports
  of the Extent and other Circumstances, especially since a little further
  time an inquiry may enable me to give you a better warranted account.</p>

  some of my Friends with the necessary Instruments: The declared reason of
  my desiring this Correspondence was (among other things) that by
  comparing Notes, <i>the Extent of the Atmospherical Changes, in point of
  Weight, might be the better estimated</i>. But not having hitherto
  received some account, that I hoped for, I shall now, without staying for
  them, intimate thus much to you: That it will be very convenient, that
  the Observers take notice not only of the <i>day</i>, but as near as they
  can, of the <i>Houre</i> wherein the height of the <i>Mercurial
  Cylinder</i> is observ'd: For I have often found, that within less than
  the compass of one day, or perhaps half a day, the Altitude of it has so
  considerably vary'd, as to make it in many cases difficult, to conclude
  any thing certainly from Observations, that agree but in the day.</p>

  <p>It will be requisite also, that the Observers give notice of the
  <i>Scituation of the place</i>, where their <i>Barometers</i> stand, not
  only, because it will assist men to Judge, whether the Instruments were
  duely perfected, but principally, because, that though the
  <i>Baroscope</i> be good (nay, because it is so) the Observations will
  much disagree, even when the <i>Atmosphere</i> is in the same state, as
  to Weight, if one of the Instruments stand in a considerably higher part
  of the Countrey, than the other.</p>

  <p>To confirm <i>both</i> the foregoing admonitions, I must now inform
  you, that, having in these parts two Lodgings, the one at <i>Oxford</i>,
  which you know stands in a bottom by the <i>Thames</i> side, and the
  other at a place four miles thence, seated upon a moderate <i>Hill</i>, I
  found, by comparing two <i>Baroscopes</i>, that I made, the one at
  <i>Oxford</i>, the other at <i>Stanton St. Johns</i>, that, though the
  former be very good, and have been noted for such, during some years, and
  the latter was very carefully fill'd; yet by reason, that in the
  <i>Higher</i> place, the incumbent part of the <i>Atmosphere</i> must be
  lighter, than in the <i>Lower</i>, there is almost <!-- Page 183 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page183"></a>{183}</span>always between 2 and 3
  Eights of an Inch difference betwixt them: And having sometimes order'd
  my servants to take notice of the Disparity, and divers times carefully
  observ'd it my self, when I pass'd to and fro between <i>Oxford</i> and
  <i>Stanton</i>, I generally found, that the <i>Oxford Barometer</i> and
  the <i>other</i>, did, as it were by common consent, rise and fall
  together so, as that in the former the <i>Mercury</i> was usually
  &#x215C; higher, than in the latter.</p>

  <p>Which Observations may teach us, that the Subterraneous steams, which
  ascend into the Air, or the other Causes of the varying Weight of the
  <i>Atmosphere</i>, do, many times, and at least in some places, uniformly
  enough affect the Air to a greater height, than, till I had made this
  tryall, I durst conclude.</p>

  <p>But, as most of the <i>Barometricall</i> observations are subject to
  exception, so I found the formerly mentioned to be. For (to omit lesser
  variations) riding one evening from <i>Oxford</i> to <i>Stanton</i>, and
  having, before I took horse, look't on the <i>Baroscope</i> in the former
  of these 2. places, I was somewhat surprised, to find at my comming to
  the latter, that in places no farther distant, and notwithstanding the
  shortness of the time (which was but an hour and a half, if so much) the
  <i>Barometer</i> at <i>Stanton</i> was short of its usual distance from
  the <i>other</i>, near a quarter of an <i>Inch</i>, though, the weather
  being fair and calm, there appear'd nothing of manifest change in the
  Air, to which I could adscribe so great a Variation; and though also,
  since that time, the <i>Mercury</i> in the two Instruments hath, for the
  most part, proceeded to rise and fall as before.</p>

  <p>And these being the only Observations, I have yet met with, wherein
  <i>Baroscopes</i>, at some <i>Distance of Place</i>, and <i>Difference of
  Height</i>, have been compar'd (though I cannot now send you the
  Reflexions, I have else where made upon them;) as the opportunity I had
  to make them my self, rendred them not unpleasant to me, so perhaps the
  Novelty will keep them from being unwelcome to you. And I confess, I have
  had some flying suspicions, that the odd <i>Phænomena</i> of the
  <i>Baroscope</i>, which have hitherto more pos'd, than instructed us, may
  in time, if a <!-- Page 184 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page184"></a>{184}</span>competent number of Correspondents do
  diligently prosecute the Inquiries (especially with <i>Baroscopes</i>,
  accommodated with Mr. <i>Hooks</i> ingenious additions) make men some
  <i>Luciferous</i> discoveries, that possibly we do not yet dream off.</p>

<div class="sidenoter">* <i>This hath been inquired into, and is found, that several Accurate and Curious persons (as the Most Noble </i>President of the Royal Society<i>, the Lord Viscount </i>Brounker<i>, </i>Doctor Beale<i>, </i>Mr. Hook<i> </i>&amp;c.<i>) have observed the same.</i></div>
  <p>I know not, whether it will be worth while to add, that since I was
  oblig'd to leave <i>London</i>, I have been put upon so many lesser
  removes, that I have not been able to make <i>Baroscopical</i>
  Observations with such a constancy, as I have wished, but, as far as I
  remember, the <i>Quick-silver</i> has been for the most part, so high, as
  to invite me to take notice of it; and to desire you to do me the favour
  to inquire among your correspondents whether they have observ'd the same
  thing. * For, if they have, this lasting (though not uninterrupted)
  Altitude of the <i>Quick-silver</i>, happening, when the Seasons of the
  year have been extraordinary dry (so much as to become a grievance, and
  to dry up, as one of the late <i>Gazettes</i> informs us, some springs
  near <i>Waymouth</i>, that used to run constantly) it may be worth
  inquiry, whether these obstinate Droughts, may not be cleaving of the
  ground too deep, and making it also in some places more porous and as it
  were, spungy, give a more copious Vent, than is usual, to subterraneal
  steams, which adscending into the Air, increase the gravity of it. The
  inducements I have to propose this inquiry, I must not now stay to
  mention. But perhaps, if the Observation holds, it may prove not useless
  in reference to some Diseases.</p>

<div class="sidenoter">* <i>See Number 9. </i>Phil. Transact.<i> p. <a href="#page157">157</a>. 5. 8 &amp; 9. where the Word, </i>Generally<i>, signifies no more, than </i>for the most part<i>.</i></div>
  <p>Perhaps it will be needless to put you in mind of directing those
  <i>Virtuosi</i>, that may desire your Instructions about
  <i>Baroscopes</i>, to set down in their Diarys not only the day of the
  month, and the hour of the day, when the <i>Mercuries</i> height is
  taken, but (in a distinct <i>Columne</i>) the weather, especially the
  Winds, both as to the Quarters, whence they blow (though that be not
  always so easy nor necessary,) and as to the Violence or Remisness,
  wherewith they blow. For, though it be more difficult, <!-- Page 185
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page185"></a>{185}</span>than one would
  think, to settle any general rule about the rising and falling of the
  <i>Quick-silver</i>; yet in these parts one of those, that seem to hold
  oftnest, is, * that when high winds blow, the <i>Mercury</i> is the
  lower; and yet that it self does sometimes fail: For, this very day
  (<i>March</i> 3.) though on that hill, where I am, the somewhat Westerly
  Winds have been blustering enough, yet ever since morning the
  <i>Quick-silver</i> has been rising, and is now risen near &#x215C; of an
  <i>Inch</i>.</p>

  <p>I had thoughts to add something about another kind of <i>Baroscope</i>
  (but inferiour to that in use) whereof I have given some intimation in
  one of the <i>Præliminaries</i> to the <i>History of Cold</i>. But you
  have already too much of a letter, and my occasions, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<div class="sidenoter">* <i>Dr. </i>Beale<i> concurs with this Observation, when he saith, in a late </i>Letter<i> of </i>March 19<i>. to his Correspondent in </i>London<i>;</i> By change of Weather and Wind, the <i>Mercury</i> is sunk more than an Inch, since I wrote to you on <i>Munday</i> last. <i>March</i> 12. This last night, by Rain and South wind, 'tis sunk <i>half an Inch</i>.</div>
  <p><i>So far that Letter.</i> Since which time, another from the same
  Noble Observer intimates, That, as for that cause of the height of the
  <i>Quick-silver</i> in Droughts, which by him is suspected to be the
  elevation of steams from the <i>Crust</i> or Superficial parts of the
  Earth, which by little and little may add to the Weight of the
  <i>Atmosphere</i>, being not, as in other seasons, carried down from time
  to time by the falling Rain, it agrees not ill with what he has had since
  occasion to observe. For, whereas about <i>March</i> 12<sup>th</sup>, at
  <i>Oxford</i>, The <i>Quick-silver</i> was higher, than, for ought he
  knew, had been yet observ'd in <i>England</i>, viz. above
  <sup>5</sup>/<sub>16</sub> above 30. <i>Inches</i>, upon the first
  considerable showers, that have interrupted our long Drought, as he
  affirms, he foretold divers hours before that the <i>Quick-silver</i>
  would be very low, (a blustering Wind concurring with the Rain) so he
  found it at <i>Stanton</i> to fall &#x215C; beneath 29.
  <i>Inches</i>.*</p>

<h3><i>General Heads for a </i>Natural History of a Countrey<i>, Great
or Small, imparted likewise by Mr. </i>Boyle<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>It having been already intimated (<i>Num. 8 of Phil. Transact.</i> p.
  <a href="#page140">140</a>. <a href="#page141">141</a>.) that divers
  <i>Philosophers</i> aime, among other things, at the Composing of a good
  Natural History, to superstruct, in time, a <i>Solid</i> and
  <i>Useful</i> Philosophy upon; and it being of no slight importance, to
  be furnisht with pertinent Heads, for the direction of Inquirers; that
  lately named <i>Benefactour to Experimental Philosophy</i>, has been
  pleased to communicate, for the ends abovesaid, the following
  <i>Articles</i>, which (as himself did signifie) belong to one of his
  <i>Essays</i> of the unpublisht part of the <i>Usefulness of Nat. and
  Experimen. Philosophy</i>.</p>

  <p>But first he premises, that what follows, is design'd only to point at
  the more <i>General</i> heads of Inquiry, which the proposer ignores not
  to be Divers of them very comprehensive, in so much, that about some of
  the <i>Subordinate</i> subjects, perhaps too, not the most fertile, he
  has drawn up <i>Articles</i> of inquisition about particulars, that take
  up near as much room, as what is here to be deliver'd of this matter.</p>

<p class="cenhead">The <i>Heads</i> themselves follow;</p>

  <p>The things, to be observ'd in such a History, may be variously (and
  almost at pleasure) divided: As, into <i>Supraterraneous,
  Terrestrial</i>, and <i>Subterraneous</i>; and otherwise: but we will at
  present distinguish them into those things, that respect the
  <i>Heavens</i>, or concern the <i>Air</i>, the <i>Water</i>, or the
  <i>Earth</i>.</p>

  <p>1. To the <i>First</i> sort of Particulars, belong the Longitude and
  Latitude of the Place (that being of moment in reference to the
  observations about the Air <i>&amp;c.</i>) and consequently the length of
  the longest and shortest days and nights, the Climate, parallels
  <i>&amp;c.</i> what fixt starrs are and what not seen there: What
  Constellations 'tis said to be subject to? Whereunto may be added other
  Astrological matters, if they be thought worth mentioning. <!-- Page 187
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page187"></a>{187}</span></p>

  <p>2. About the <i>Air</i> may be observ'd, its Temperature, as to the
  first four Qualities (commonly so call'd) and the Measures of them: its
  Weight, Clearness, Refractive power: its Sublety or Grossness: its
  abounding with, or wanting an <i>Esurine</i> Salt: its variations
  according to the seasons of the year, and the times of the day; What
  duration the several kinds of Weather usually have: What <i>Meteors</i>
  it is most or least wont to breed; and in what order they are generated;
  and how long they usually last: Especially, what Winds it is subject to;
  whether any of them be stated and ordinary, <i>&amp;c.</i> What diseases
  are Epidemical, that are supposed to flow from the Air: What other
  diseases, wherein <i>that</i> hath a share, the Countrey is subject to;
  the Plague and Contagious sicknesses: What is the usual salubrity or
  insalubrity of the Air; and with what Constitutions it agrees better or
  worse, than others.</p>

  <p>3. About the <i>Water</i>, may be observ'd, the Sea, its Depth, degree
  of Saltness, Tydes, Currents, <i>&amp;c.</i> <i>Next</i>, Rivers, their
  Bigness, Length, Course, Inundations, Goodness, Levity (or their
  Contraries) of Waters, <i>&amp;c.</i> <i>Then</i>, Lakes, Ponds, Springs,
  and especially Mineral waters, their Kinds, Qualities, Vertues, and how
  examined. To the <i>Waters</i> belong also <i>Fishes</i>, what kinds of
  them (whether Salt or Fresh-water fish) are to be found in the Country;
  their Store, Bigness, Goodness, Seasons, Haunts, Peculiarities of any
  kind, and the wayes of taking them, especially those that are not purely
  <i>Mechanical</i>.</p>

  <p>4. In the <i>Earth</i>, may be observed,</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>1. <i>It self.</i></p>

  <p>2. Its <i>Inhabitants</i>, and its <i>Productions</i>, and these
  <i>External</i>, and <i>Internal</i>.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p><i>First</i>, in the Earth <i>it self</i>, may be observ'd, its
  dimensions, scituation, East, West, North, and South: its Figure, its
  Plains, and Valleys, and their Extent; its Hills and Mountains, and the
  height of the tallest, both in reference to the neighbouring Valleys or
  Plains, and in reference to the Level of the Sea: As <!-- Page 188
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page188"></a>{188}</span>also, whether
  the Mountains lye scattered, or in ridges, and whether those run North
  and South, or East and West, <i>&amp;c.</i> What Promontories, fiery or
  smoaking Hills, <i>&amp;c.</i> the Country has, or hath not: Whether the
  Country be coherent, or much broken into Ilands. What the Magnetical
  Declination is in several places, and the Variations of that Declination
  in the same place (and, if either of those be very considerable, then,
  what circumstances may assist one to guess at the Reason as Subterraneal
  fires, the Vicinity of Iron-mines, <i>&amp;c.</i>) what the Nature of the
  Soyle is, whether Clays, Sandy, <i>&amp;c.</i> or good Mould; and what
  Grains, Fruits, and other Vegetables, do the most naturally agree with
  it: As also, by what particular Arts and Industries the Inhabitants
  improve the Advantages, and remedy the Inconveniences of their Soyl: What
  hidden qualities the Soyl may have (as that of <i>Ireland</i>, against
  Venemous Beasts, <i>&amp;c.</i>)</p>

  <p><i>Secondly</i>, above the ignobler <i>Productions</i> of the Earth,
  there must be a careful account given of the <i>Inhabitants</i>
  themselves, both <i>Natives</i> and <i>Strangers</i>, that have been long
  settled there: And in particular, their Stature, Shape, Colour, Features,
  Strength, Agility, Beauty (or the want of it) Complexions, Hair, Dyet,
  Inclinations, and Customs that seem not due to Education. As to their
  Women (besides the other things) may be observed their Fruitfulness or
  Barrenness; their hard or easy Labour, <i>&amp;c.</i> And both in Women
  and Men must be taken notice of what diseases they are subject to, and in
  these whether there be any symptome, or any other Circumstance, that is
  unusual and remarkable.</p>

  <p>As to the <i>External</i> Productions of the Earth, the Inquiries may
  be such as these: What Grasses, Grains, Herbs, (Garden and Wild) Flowers,
  Fruit-trees, Timber-trees (especially any Trees, whose wood is
  considerable) Coppices, Groves, Woods, Forrests, <i>&amp;c.</i> the
  Country has or wants: What peculiarities are observable in any of them:
  What Soyles they most like or dislike; and with what Culture they thrive
  best. What <i>Animals</i> the Country has or wants, both as to wild
  Beasts, Hawks, and other Birds of Prey; and as to Poultrey, and <!-- Page
  189 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page189"></a>{189}</span>Cattle of
  all sorts, and particularly, whether it have any <i>Animals</i>, that are
  not common, or any thing, that is peculiar in those, that are so.</p>

  <p>The <i>Internal</i> Productions or Concealments of the Earth are here
  understood to be, the riches that ly hid under the Ground, and are not
  already referr'd to other Inquiries.</p>

  <p>Among these <i>Subterraneal</i> observations may be taken notice of,
  what sorts of Minerals of any kind they want, as well as what they have;
  <i>Then</i>, what Quarries the Country affords, and the particular
  conditions both of the Quarries and the Stones: As also, how the Beds of
  Stone lye, in reference to North and South, <i>&amp;c.</i> What Clays and
  Earths it affords, as Tobacco-pipe-clay, Marles, Fullers-earths, Earths
  for Potters wares, Bolus's and other medicated Earths: What other
  Minerals it yields, as Coals, Salt-Mines, or Salt-springs, Allom,
  Vitrial, Sulphur, <i>&amp;c.</i> What Mettals the Country yields; and a
  description of the Mines, their number, scituation, depth, signs, waters,
  damps, quantities of ore, goodness of ore, extraneous things and ways of
  reducing their ores into Mettals, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

  <p>To these General Articles of inquiries (saith their <i>Proposer</i>)
  should be added; 1 <i>Inquiries</i> about <i>Traditions</i> concerning
  all particular things, relating to that Country, as either peculiar to
  it, or at least, uncommon elsewhere, 2 <i>Inquiries</i>, that require
  <i>Learning</i> or <i>Skill</i> in the Answerer: to which should be
  subjoyned <i>Proposals</i> of ways, to enable men to give Answers to
  these more difficult inquiries.</p>

  <p><i>Thus far</i> our Author, who, as he has been pleased to impart
  these <i>General</i> (but yet very <i>Comprehensive</i> and greatly
  <i>Directive</i>) Articles; so, 'tis hoped from his own late intimation,
  that he will shortly enlarge them with <i>Particular</i> and
  <i>Subordinate</i> ones. These, in the mean time, were thought fit to be
  publisht, that the Inquisitive and Curious, might, by such an Assistance,
  be invited not to delay their searches of matters, that are so highly
  conducive to the improvement of <i>True Philosophy</i>, and the wellfare
  of <i>Mankind</i>. <!-- Page 190 --><span class="pagenum"><a

<h3><i>An Extract
of a Letter, Written from </i>Holland<i>, about </i>Preserving of
Ships from being Worm-eaten<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>This <i>Extract</i> is borrowed from the <i>French journal des
  Scavans</i> of <i>Febr.</i> 15. 1666. and is here inserted, to excite
  Inventive heads <i>here</i>, to overtake the Proposer in <i>Holland</i>.
  The letter runs thus:</p>

  <p>Although you have visited our Port (<i>Amsterdam</i>) I know not
  whether you have noted the ill condition, our ships are in, that return
  from the <i>Indies</i>. There is in those Seas a kind of small worms,
  that fasten themselves to the Timber of the ships, and so pierce them,
  that they take water every where; or if they do not altogether pierce
  them thorow, they so weaken the wood, that it is almost impossible to
  repair them. We have at present a Man here, that pretends to have found
  an admirable secret to remedy this evil. That, which would render this
  secret the more important, is, that hitherto very many ways have been
  used to effect it, but without success. Some have imployed Deal, Hair and
  Lime, <i>&amp;c.</i> and therewith lined their ships; but, besides that
  this does not altogether affright the worms, it retards much the ship's
  Course. The <i>Portugals</i> scorch their ships, insomuch that in the
  quick works there is made a coaly crust of about an <i>Inch</i> thick.
  But as this is dangerous, it happening not seldom, that the whole vessel
  is burnt; so the reason why worms eat not thorow <i>Portugal</i> ships,
  is conceived to be the exceeding hardness of the Timber, employed by
  them.</p>

  <p>We expect with impatience the nature and effect of this Proposition.
  Many have already ventur'd to give their thoughts concerning it. Some
  say, there needs no more, but to build Ships of a harder kind of Wood,
  than the usual. Others having observed, that these Worms fasten not to a
  kind of wild <i>Indian</i> Pear-tree, which is highly bitter, do
  thereupon <!-- Page 191 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page191"></a>{191}</span>suggest, that the best Expedient would be,
  to find out a Wood having that quality. But certainly there being now no
  Timber, fit for Ships, that is not known, 'tis not likely that any will
  be found either more hard, or more bitter, than that, which has been
  hitherto employed. Some do imagine, that the Proposer will, by certain
  <i>Lixiviums</i>, give to the ordinary Wood such a quality and
  bitterness, as is found in the already mention'd <i>Indian</i> Pear-tree.
  But this also will hardly succeed, since it will be requisite not only to
  make <i>Lixiviums</i>, in great quantities at an easie rate, and strong
  enough to penetrate the thick sides of a Ship, but also to make them
  durable enough, not to be wash't out by the Sea. Yet notwithstanding, in
  these matters one ought to suspend on's judgement, untill experience do
  shew, what is to be believed of them.</p>

  <p><i>So far the Extract.</i> To which it may perhaps not be unseasonable
  to add, that a very worthy person in <i>London</i>, suggests the Pitch,
  drawn out of Sea coles, for a good Remedy to scare away these noysome
  insects.</p>

<h3><i>An Account
of a Book, very lately publish't, entituled, </i>The Origine
of Forms and Qualities<i>, illustrated by Considerations
and Experiments, by the Honourable </i>Robert Boyle<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>This Curious and Excellent Piece, is a kind of <i>Introduction</i> to
  the <i>Principles</i> of the <i>Mechanical Philosophy</i>, explicating,
  by very Considerable Observations and Experiments, what may be, according
  to such Principles, conceived of the <i>Nature and Origine of Qualities
  and Forms</i>; the knowledge whereof, either makes or supposes the
  Fundamental and Useful part of <i>Natural Philosophy</i>. In doing of
  which, the Author, to have his way the clearer, writes rather for the
  <i>Corpuscularian</i> Philosophers (as he is pleased to call them) in
  <i>General</i>, than any <!-- Page 192 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page192"></a>{192}</span><i>Party</i> of them, keeping himself
  thereby disengaged from adopting an <i>Hypothesis</i>, in which perhaps
  he is not so throughly satisfied, and of which he does not conceive
  himself to be necessitated to make use here; and accordingly forbearing
  to employ Arguments, that are either grounded on, <i>or</i> suppose
  <i>Atoms</i>, <i>or</i> any <i>Innate Motion</i> belonging to them;
  <i>or</i> that the Essence of Bodies consists in Extension; <i>or</i>
  that a <i>Vacuum</i> is impossible; <i>or</i> that there are such
  <i>Globuli Cælestes, or</i> such a <i>Materia Subtilis</i>, as the
  <i>Cartesians</i> imploy to explicate most of the <i>Phænomena</i> of
  Nature.</p>

  <p>The <i>Treatise</i> consisting of a <i>Speculative</i>, and an
  <i>Historical</i> part, the Author, with great modesty leaves the
  <i>Reader</i> to judge; <i>Whether</i> in the <i>First</i> part he hath
  treated of the <i>Nature</i> and <i>Origine of Forms and Qualities</i> in
  a more Comprehensive way, than others; <i>Whether</i> he has by fit
  Examples, and other means, rendred it more intelligible, than they have
  done: <i>Whether</i> he has added any considerable number of Notions and
  Arguments towards the compleating and confirming of the proposed
  <i>Hypothesis</i>: <i>Whether</i> he has with reason dismissed Arguments
  unfit to be relied on; and <i>Whether</i> he has proposed some Notions
  and Arguments so warily, as to keep them from being liable to Exceptions
  and Evasions, whereto they were obnoxious, as others have proposed them.
  And, as to the <i>Second</i> and <i>Historical</i> part, he is enclin'd
  to believe that the <i>Reader</i> will grant, he hath done that part of
  <i>Physicks</i>, he is treating of, some service, by strengthning the
  doctrines of the <i>New Philosophy</i> (as 'tis call'd) by such
  particular Experiments, whose Nature and Novelty will render them as well
  Acceptable as Instructive.</p>

  <p>The <i>summe</i> of the <i>Hypothesis</i>, fully and clearly
  explicated in the <i>First</i> Part, is this;</p>

  <p>That all Bodies are made of <i>one Catholick matter</i>, common to
  them all, and differ but in <i>Shape, Size, Motion</i> or <i>Rest</i>,
  and <i>Texture</i> of the small parts, they consist off; from which <!--
  Page 193 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page193"></a>{193}</span>Affections of Matter, the <i>Qualites</i>,
  that difference particular Bodies, result: whence it may be rationally
  concluded, that one kind of Bodies may be transmuted into another;
  <i>that</i> being in effect no more, than that one Parcel of the
  Universal Matter, wherein all Bodies agree, may have a <i>Texture</i>
  produced in it, like the <i>Texture</i> of some other Parcel of Matter,
  common to them both.</p>

  <p>To this <i>Hypothesis</i>, is subjoin'd an Examination of the
  <i>Scholastick</i> opinion of <i>Substantial Forms</i>; where the Author,
  <i>first</i>, States the Controversie; <i>next</i>, gives the Principal
  reasons, that move him to oppose that Opinion; <i>then</i>, answers the
  Main arguments employed to evince it; <i>further</i>, assigns both the
  <i>First</i> Cause of Forms (<i>God</i>;) and the Grand <i>Second</i>
  Cause thereof (<i>Local Motion</i>:) and <i>lastly</i>, proves the
  <i>Mechanical</i> Production of <i>Forms</i>; grounding his proof,
  <i>partly</i> upon the Manner, by which such a <i>Convention of
  Accidents</i>, as deserve to pass for a <i>Form</i>, may be
  <i>produced</i>; as that the Curious Shapes of <i>Salts</i> (believed to
  be the admirablest Effects and strongest Proofs of <i>Substantial
  Forms</i>) may be the Results of <i>Texture</i>; <i>Art</i> being able to
  produce Vitriol, as well as <i>Nature</i>: <i>partly</i>, upon the
  possibility of <i>Reproducing</i> Bodies by skill, that have been
  deprived of their reputed <i>Substantial Forms</i>: Where he alledges the
  <i>Redintegration of Saltpetre</i>, successfully performed by himself;
  though his Attempts, made upon the dissipation and re-union of
  <i>Amber</i>, <i>Allum</i>, <i>Sea-Salt</i>, and <i>Vitriol</i>, proved
  (by reason of <i>accidental</i> hindrances rather, than of any
  impossibility in the Nature of the Thing) less successful.</p>

  <p>In the <i>Second</i> and <i>Historical</i> Part, the Author, appealing
  to the Testimony of Nature, to verifie his Doctrine, sets down,
  <i>both</i> some <i>Observations</i>, of what Nature does without being
  over-ruled by the power and skill of man; and some <i>Experiments</i>,
  wherein Nature is guided, and as it were, mastered by Art.</p>

<p class="cenhead">The <i>Observations</i> are four.</p>

  <p>1. The <i>First</i> is taken from what happens in the <i>Hatching
  of</i> <!-- Page 194 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page194"></a>{194}</span><i>an Egge</i>; out of the <i>White</i>
  whereof, which is a substance Similar, insipid, soft, diaphanous,
  colourless, and readily dissoluble in cold water, there is by the
  <i>New</i> and <i>Various</i> contrivement of its small parts, caused by
  the Incubation of the Hen, an Animal produced, some of whose parts are
  opacous, some red, some yellow, some white, some fluid, some consistent,
  some solid and frangible, others tough and flexible, some well, some
  ill-tasted, some with springs, some without springs, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

  <p>2. The <i>Second</i> is fetcht from <i>Water</i>, which being fluid,
  tastless, inodorous, diaphanous, colourless, volatile, <i>&amp;c.</i> may
  by a <i>Differing Texture</i> of its parts, be brought to constitute
  Bodies, having qualities very distant from these, as <i>Vegetables</i>,
  that have firmeness, opacity, odors, tasts, colours, Medicinal vertues;
  yielding also a true <i>Oyle</i>, that refuses to mingle with
  <i>Water</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

  <p>3. The <i>Third</i>, from <i>Inoculation</i>; wherein, a small
  <i>Bud</i> is able to transmute all the sap, that arrives at it, as to
  make it constitute a Fruit quite otherwise qualified, then that, which is
  the <i>genuine</i> production of the Tree, so that the same sap, that in
  one part of the Branch constitutes (for Instance) a <i>Cluster of
  Haws</i>, in another part of the same Branch, may make a <i>Pear</i>.
  Where the Author mentions divers other very considerable Effects of
  Inoculations, and inserts several Histories, all countenancing his
  doctrine.</p>

  <p>4. The <i>Fourth</i>, from <i>Putrified Cheese</i>; wherein, the
  <i>rotten</i> part, by the alteration of its Texture, will differ from
  the <i>Sound</i>, in colour, odor, taste, consistence, vermination,
  <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p class="cenhead">The Experiments are ten.</p>

  <p>1. <i>A Solution of Vitriol and Camphire</i>; in which by a change of
  Texture, appear'd the Production of a deep colour from a <!-- Page 195
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page195"></a>{195}</span>white Body,
  and a clear Liquor without any external heat: The destruction of this
  Colour, by adding only some fair water: The change of an Odorous Body,
  <i>as Camphire</i>, into an Inodorous, by mixing it with a Body, that has
  scarce any sensible odour of its own: The sudden restauration of the
  <i>Camphire</i> to its native scent and other qualities, by common water,
  <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

  <p>2. <i>Sublimate, distill'd from Copper and Silver</i>, which both did
  wholly loose their Metalline forms, and were melted into brittle lumps,
  with colours quite differing from their own; both apt to imbibe the
  moisture of the Air, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

  <p>3. <i>A solution of silver into Luna Cornea</i>: Whereby the opacous,
  malleable and hardly fusible Body of <i>Silver</i>, was, by the addition
  of a little spirit of salt, reduced into Chrystals, differing from those
  of other Mettals; diaphanous also, and brittle, and far more easily
  fusible, than Silver; wholly unlike either a Salt or a Mettal, but very
  like to a piece of <i>Horn</i>, and withall insipid, though the Solution
  of Silver, be very bitter, and the spirit of salt, highly sowre,
  <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

  <p>4. <i>An Anomalous Salt</i>; (which the Author had not, it seems the
  liberty to teach the Preparation off) whose Ingredients were purely
  Saline, and yet the Compound, made up only of salt, sowre, and strongly
  tasted Bodies, was rather <i>really</i> sweet, than of any other taste ,
  and when a little urged with heat, its odour became stronger, and more
  insupportable than that of <i>Aqua fortis</i>, <i>distilled Urine</i> and
  even <i>spirit of salt Ammoniack</i>; but yet when these Fumes settled
  again into salt, their odour would again prove inoffensive, if not
  pleasant <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

  <p>5. <i>A Sea-salt, whence Aqua fortis had been distilled</i>: Where the
  Liquor, that came over, proved an <i>Aqua Regis</i>: the substance in the
  bottom, had not onely a mild taste, and <!-- Page 196 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page196"></a>{196}</span>affected the Pallat
  much more like salt-peter, than Common salt; but was also very fusible,
  and inflammable, though produced of two un-inflammable bodies: and the
  same substance, consisting of <i>Acid</i> salts, by a certain way of the
  Author, produced a <i>Fixt</i> salt.</p>

  <p>6. <i>Oyle of Vitriol poured upon a Solution of Bay-salt:</i> whence
  was abstracted a liquor, that by the smell and Taste appeared to be a
  spirit of salt. In which operation, the mixture, by working a great
  change of Texture, did so alter the nature of the compounding Bodies,
  that the sea-salt, though a considerably fixt Body, was distill'd over in
  a moderate Fire of sand, whilst the Oyl of Vitriol, though no such gross
  salt, was by the same operation so fixt, as to stay behind: Besides that
  the same, by a competent heat yeilded a substance, though not insipid,
  yet not at all of the taste of Sea-salt, or of any other pungent one,
  much less having the highly corrosive acidity of oyl of Vitriol,
  <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

  <p>7. <i>A dissolvent, made by pouring a strong spirit of Nitre on the
  rectified Oyl of the Butter of Antimony, and then distilling off all the
  liquor, that would come over, &amp;c.</i> This <i>Menstruum</i> (called
  by the Author <i>Peracutum</i>) being put to highly refined Gold,
  destroyed its Texture, and produced, after the method prescribed in the
  book, a <i>true Silver</i>, as its whiteness in colour, dissolublenes in
  <i>Aqua fortis</i>, and odious Bitterness, did manifest: which change of
  a Mettal, commonly esteemed to be absolutely indestructible by Art,
  though it be far from being <i>Lucriferous</i>, is yet exceedingly
  <i>Instructive</i>; as is also the way, the Author here adds, of
  <i>Volatilizing</i> Gold, by the power of the same <i>Dissolvent</i>.</p>

  <p>8. <i>Aqua fortis, concoagulated with differing Bodies</i>, produced
  very differing Concretes: And the same Numeral Saline Corpuscles, that
  being associated with those of one Mettal, had already produced a Body
  eminent in one Taste, did <!-- Page 197 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page197"></a>{197}</span>afterwards, being freed from that Body,
  compose a Liquor of a very differing taste; and after <i>that</i> too,
  being combin'd with the parties of another Mettal, did with them
  constitute a Body of a very eminent Taste, as opposite as any one can be
  to both the other Tasts; and yet these Saline Corpuscles, being instead
  of this second Mettal, associated with such a one as that, they are
  driven from, did therewith exhibite again the first of the three
  mention'd Tasts.</p>

  <p>9. <i>Water transmuted into Earth</i>, though the Author saith of this
  Transmutation, that it was not so perfect, as he wish'd, and as he hopes
  to make it.</p>

  <p>10. <i>A mixture of Oyle of Vitriol and Spirit of Wine.</i> These two
  Liquors, being of odd Textures in reference to each other, their
  conjunction and distillation made them exhibite these <i>Phænomena</i>:
  <i>vid.</i> That, whereas Spirit of Wine has no great, nor good scent,
  and moderately dephlegm'd Oyl of Vitriol is wont to be inodorous; the
  Spirit, that first came over from their mixture, had a scent not only
  very differing from Spirit of Wine, but from all things else, that the
  Author ever smelt; the Odor being very fragrant &amp; pleasant, and so
  subtle, that in spight of the care taken in luting the Glasses exactly
  together, it would perfume the neighbouring parts of the
  <i>Laboratory</i>, and afterwards smell strongly at some distance from
  the Viol, wherein it was put, though stopt with a close Cork covered with
  two or three several Bladders. But, after this volatile and odoriferous
  Spirit was come over, and had been follow'd by an Acid Spirit, it was at
  last succeeded by a strongly stinking Liquor, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

  <p>But <i>Manum de Tabula</i>: the Book it self will certainly give a
  satisfaction far beyond what here can be said of it. <!-- Page 198

<h3><i>Some New observations about the Planet </i>Mars<i>, communicated
since the Printing of the former sheets.</i></h3>

  <p>There was very lately produced a Paper, containing some observations,
  made by Mr. <i>Hook</i>, about the Planet <i>Mars</i>; in the <i>Face</i>
  whereof he affirmed to have discovered, in the late months of
  <i>February</i> and <i>March</i>, that there are several <i>Maculæ</i> or
  <i>Spotted parts</i>, changing their place, and not returning to the same
  Position, till the next ensuing night near about the same time. Whence it
  may be collected, that <i>Mars</i> (as well as <i>Jupiter</i>, and the
  <i>Earth</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i>) does move about his own <i>Axis</i>, of
  which a fuller account will be given hereafter, God permitting. This
  short and hasty intimation of it, is intended onely to invite others,
  that have opportunity, timely to make Observations, (either to confirm,
  or rectify) before <i>Mars</i> gets out of sight.</p>

<h3><i>A way
of preserving Birds taken out of the Egge, and other small
</i>Fætus's<i>; communicated by </i>Mr. Boyle<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>This was imparted in a Letter, as follows;</p>

  <p>The time of the year invites me to intimate to you, that among the
  other Uses of the Experiment, I long since presented the <i>Society</i>,
  of preserving Whelps taken out of the Dams womb, and other
  <i>Fætus's</i>, or parts of them, in <i>Spirit of Wine</i>; I <!-- Page
  200 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page200"></a>{200}</span>remember,
  I did, when I was sollicitous to observe the Processe of Nature in the
  Formation of a Chick, open Hens Eggs, some at such a day, and some at
  other daies after the beginning of the Incubation, and carefully taking
  out the <i>Embryo's</i>, embalmed each of them in a distinct Glass (which
  is to be carefully stopt) in <i>Spirit of Wine</i>: Which I did, that so
  I might have them in readinesse, to make on them, at any time, the
  Observations, I thought them capable of affording; and to let my Friends
  at other seasons of the year, see, <i>both</i> the differing appearances
  of the Chick at the third, fourth, seventh, fourteenth, or other daies,
  after the Eggs had been sate on, <i>and</i> (especially) some particulars
  not obvious in Chickens, that go about; as the hanging of the Gutts out
  of the <i>Abdomen</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i> How long the tender <i>Embryo</i>
  of the Chick soon after the <i>Punctum saliens</i> is discoverable,
  <i>and</i> whilst the Body seems but a little Organized Gelly, <i>and</i>
  some while after <i>That</i>, will be this way preserv'd, without being
  too much shrivel'd up, I was hindred by some mischances to satisfie my
  self: but when the <i>Fætus's</i>, I took out, were so perfectly formed
  as they were wont to be about the seventh day, and after, they so well
  retain'd their shape and bulk, as to make me not repent of my curiosity:
  And some of those, which I did very early this Spring, I can yet shew
  you. I know I have mention'd to you an easie application of what I, some
  year since, made publick enough; but not finding it to have been yet made
  by any other, and being perswaded by Experience, that it may be extended
  to other <i>Fætus's</i>, which this season (the <i>Spring</i>) is time to
  make provision off, I think the <i>Advertisement</i> will not seem
  unseasonable to some of our Friends; though being now in haste, and
  having in my thoughts divers particulars, relating to this way of
  Preserving Birds taken out of the Egge, and other small <i>Fætus's</i>, I
  must content my self to have mention'd that, which is <i>Essential</i>,
  leaving divers other things, which a little practise may teach the
  Curious, unmention'd. Notwithstanding which, I must not omit these two
  Circumstances; the <i>one</i>, that when the Chick was grown big, before
  I took it out of the Egge, I have (but not constantly) <!-- Page 201
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page201"></a>{201}</span><span
  class="sidenoter">* <i>In the Usefulness of Experimental
  Philosophy.</i></span> mingled with the <i>Spirit of Wine</i>, a little
  Spirit of <i>Sal Armoniack</i>, made (as I have elsewhere delivered) * by
  the help of <i>Quick-lime</i>: which Spirit I choose, because, though it
  abounds in a Salt not Sowre, but Urinous, yet I never observed it (how
  strong soever I made it) to coagulate Spirit of Wine. The <i>other</i>
  circumstance is, that I usually found it convenient, to let the little
  <i>Animals</i>, I meant to imbalme, lie for a little while in ordinary
  Spirit of Wine, to wash off the looser filth, that is wont to adhere to
  the Chick, when taken out of the Egge; and then, having put either the
  same kind of Spirit, or better upon the same Bird, I suffer'd it to soak
  some hours (perhaps some daies, <i>pro re nata</i>) therein, that the
  Liquor, having drawn as it were what Tincture it could, the <i>Fætus</i>
  being remov'd into more pure and well dephlegm'd Spirit of Wine, might
  not discolour it, but leave it almost as limpid, as before it was put
  in.</p>

<h3><i>An Extract
of a Letter, sent lately to Sir </i>Robert Moray<i> out of </i>Virginia<i>,
concerning an </i>unusual<i> way of propagating </i>Mulberry
trees<i> there, for the better improvement of the </i>Silk-Work<i>;
together with some other particulars, tending to
the good of that </i>Plantation<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>I am disappointed at this time of some Rarities of Minerals, Mettals,
  and Stones; but you may have them any other time, as conveniently,
  <i>&amp;c.</i> I have planted here already ten thousand <i>Mulberry
  trees</i>; and hope, within two or three years, to reap good silk of
  them. I have planted them in a way unusual here, which advances them two
  or three years growth, in respect of their being sown in seed: And they
  are now, at writing hereof all holding good, although this has been a
  very long and bitter winter with us, much longer and colder, than ever I
  did find it in <i>Scotland</i> or <i>England</i>. I intend likewise to
  plant <!-- Page 202 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page202"></a>{202}</span>them all, as if they were <i>Currants</i>
  or <i>Goos-berries</i>, so thick as hedges; whereby one man may gather as
  many of them, as otherwise, when they are planted in trees at distance,
  four persons my do. Expedient is the benefit of this Trade. Having
  discoursed of this new way to all here; they are generally inclinable to
  it; considering that the Planting their Trees, as before, at distance,
  and letting them grow high, has been the main obstruction of that work
  hitherto, and the loss of their time and gain: but being in hedges, they
  will be always young tender plants; and consequently will be easily cut
  in great quantities with a pair of Garden Sizzers. But there may be
  suggested yet another, and perhaps a better way; which is, to sowe some
  Acres with <i>Mulberry seed</i>, and to cut it with a sith, and ever to
  keep it under. I have also bethought my self of a new way, for a few
  hands to serve many Worms, and that more cleanly than before: which also
  will be a means, without more trouble or pains, to separate unhealthy
  worms from healthful; and by which a great many more may be kept in a
  room, than otherwise upon shelves, as is usual here. Besides this, I have
  sown a little <i>French Barley</i> and <i>Rice seed</i>, and am thinking
  on a way of un-husking them with expedition, and so preparing them for
  the Merchant, as they use to be: But if you can inform me, how they are
  prepared, you may save me some labour. If I had any <i>Coffee</i> in
  husks, or any other vegetable commodity, from the Streights to try, I
  would here make tryal with them. Its like, that some of those Merchants
  that are of your <i>Society</i>, and keep a Correspondency there, may
  assist in procuring them. By the latter ships I intend to send you a New
  sort of sweet sented <i>Tobacco</i>, which I have not yet had time to
  improve.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<h3><i>A Method, by which a Glass of a small Plano-convex Sphere
may be made to refract the Rayes of light to a </i>Focus<i> of
a far greater distance, than is usual.</i></h3>

  <p>This is proposed by Mr. <i>Hook</i>, in consequence of what was <!--
  Page 203 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page203"></a>{203}</span>mention'd from him in <i>Numb.</i> 4
  <i>pag.</i> <a href="#page67">67</a>, of these <i>Transactions</i>.</p>

  <p>Prepare (<i>saith he</i>) two Glasses, the one exactly flat on both
  sides, the other flat on the one side, and convex on the other, of what
  Sphere you please. Let the flat Glass be a little broader than the other.
  Then let there be made a Cell or Ring of Brass, very exactly turn'd, into
  which these two Glasses may be so fastened with Cement, that the plain
  surfaces of them may lye exactly paralell, and that the Convex-side of
  the Plano-convex-Glass may lye inward; but so, as not to touch the flat
  of the other Glass. These being cemented into the Ring very closely about
  the edges, by a small hole in the side of the Brass-ring or Cell, fill
  the interposed space between these two with <i>Water</i>, <i>Oyl of
  Turpentine</i>, <i>Spirit of Wine</i>, <i>Saline Liquors</i>,
  <i>&amp;c;</i> then stop the hole with a screw: and according to the
  differing refraction of the interposed Liquors, so shall the <i>Focus</i>
  of the compound Glass be longer or shorter.</p>

  <p>But this (adds the <i>Proposer</i>) I would only have look't upon, as
  one instance of many (for there may be others) of the <i>Possibility</i>
  of making a Glass, ground in a smaller Sphere, to constitute a Telescope
  of a much greater length: Though (not to raise too great exspectation) I
  must add, That of <i>Spherical</i> object glasses, those are the best,
  which are made of the greatest Sphere, and whose substance hath the
  greatest refraction.</p>

<h3><i>Observations
about </i>Shining Worms<i> in Oysters.</i></h3>

  <p>These Observations occur in the <i>French journal</i> of <i>April</i>
  12. 1666. in two letters, written by M. <i>Auzout</i> to M. <i>Dela
  Voye</i>; whereof the substance may be reduced to the following
  particulars.</p>

  <p>1. That M. <i>Dela Voye</i> having observed, as he thought, <!-- Page
  204 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page204"></a>{204}</span>some
  shining Worms in Oysters; M. <i>Auzout</i>, being made acquainted with
  it, did first conceive, they were not Worms (unless they were crushed
  ones) that shin'd, as having not been able then to discern any parts of a
  Worm; but only some shining clammy moysture; which appeared indeed like a
  little Star of a blewish colour, and stuck to the Oyster-shell; being
  drawn out, shone in the Air its whole length (which was about four or
  five lines,) and when put upon the <i>Observers</i> hand, continued to
  shine there for some time.</p>

  <p>2. That M. <i>Auzout</i> afterwards, causing more than 20. douzen of
  Oysters to be open'd at Candle-light, really saw, in the dark, such
  shining worms in them; and those of three sorts. <i>One</i> sort was
  whitish, having 24. or 25. feet on each side, forked; a black speck on
  one side of the head (taken by him for a <i>Chrystallin</i>) &amp; the
  back like an Eele, stript off her skin. The <i>second</i>, red, and
  resembling the common <i>Glow-worms</i>, found at Land, with folds upon
  their backs, and feet like the former; and with a nose like that of a
  dog, and one eye in the head. The <i>third</i> sort was speckled, having
  a head like that of a Sole, with many tufts of whitish hair on the sides
  of it,</p>

  <p>3. That, besides these, the <i>Observer</i> saw some much bigger, that
  were grayish, with a big head, and two horns on it, like those of a
  Snayl, and with 7. or 8. whitish feet, but these, though kept by him in
  the night, shin'd not.</p>

  <p>4. That the two first sorts are made of a matter easily resoluble, the
  least shaking or touch turning them in into a viscous and aqueous matter;
  which falling from the shell, stuck to the <i>Observers</i> fingers, and
  shone there for the space of 20. seconds: and if any little part of this
  matter, by strongly shaking the shell, did fall to the ground, it
  appear'd like a little piece of a flaming Brimstone; and when shaken off
  nimbly, it became like a small shining Line, which was dissipated before
  it came to the ground.</p>

<p><!-- Page 205 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page205"></a>{205}</span></p>

  <p>5. That this shining matter was of different colour; some, whitish,
  some, reddish; but yet that they afforded both, a light which appear'd a
  violet to his eye.</p>

  <p>6. That it is very hard to examine these worms entire (especially the
  white ones) because that at the least touch they doe burst, and resolve
  into a glutinous moysture; whence also if it were not for their feet,
  that are discover'd in their matter, none would judge them to be
  Worms.</p>

  <p>7. That among those, which he observed, he saw two more firm, than the
  rest, which shone all over; and when they fell from the Oyster, twinkled
  like a great star, shining strongly, and emitting rays of a violet-light
  by turns, for the space, (as touch't above) of 20. seconds. Which
  Scintillation the <i>Observer</i> imputes to this, that those worms being
  alive, and sometimes raising their head, sometimes their tayle, like a
  Carpe, the light increased and lessened accordingly; seeing that, when
  they shone not, he did, viewing them by a Candle, find them dead.</p>

  <p>8. That forcibly shaking the Oyster-shells in the dark, he sometimes
  saw the whole shell full of lights, now and then as big as a fingers end;
  and abundance of this clammy matter, both red and white, (which he judges
  to have been Worms) burst in their holes.</p>

  <p>9. That in the shaking he saw all the Communications of these little
  Verminulous holes, like to the hole of Worms in Wood.</p>

  <p>10. That in more than 20 douzen of Oysters he shook no shell (10. or
  12. excepted) but it emitted light: And found some of this light in
  sixteen of the Oysters themselves.</p>

  <p>11. That this light occurs more frequently in big, than small Oysters;
  in those that are pierced by the Worm, oftner, than <!-- Page 206
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page206"></a>{206}</span>in those that
  are not, and rather upon the Convex-side, than the other; and more in
  fresh ones; than in the stale.</p>

  <p>12. That having somewhat scaled the Convex-side of the shell, and
  discover'd the Communication of the holes, wherein the often-mention'd
  viscous moysture, that has any form of insects, is found; he smelt a
  scent, that was like the water of a squeesed Oyster.</p>

  <p>13. That the Worms give no light, when irritated, but if they do, the
  light lasts but a very little time, whereas that which appears in those,
  that were not angred before, continues a great while; the <i>Observer</i>
  affirming to have kept of it above 2 hours.</p>

  <p>So far the <i>Journal des Scavans</i>; which intimates withal, that if
  the <i>Observers</i> had had better <i>Microscopes</i>, they could have
  better examin'd this matter.</p>

  <p>But since the curious here in <i>England</i> are so well furnish with
  good ones, 'tis hoped, that they will employ some of them for further and
  more minute Observations of these Worms; it being a matter, which, joyned
  with other Observations, already made by some excellent persons here,
  (especially Mr. <i>Boyle</i>) upon this subject of Light, may prove very
  luciferous to the doctrine of it, so much yet in the dark.</p>

<h3><i>Some Observations
of the Effects of </i>Touch<i> and </i>Friction<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>The Operations and Effects of <i>Touch</i> and <i>Friction</i> having
  been lately much taken notice off, and being lookt upon by some, as a
  great <i>Medical</i> Branch, for the curing of many diseases and
  infirmities; it will perhaps not be unseasonable to mention (here also)
  some Observations relating thereunto; which may give an occasion to
  others, to consider this subject more, than has been done heretofore, and
  to make <!-- Page 207 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page207"></a>{207}</span>further Observations and Tryals concerning
  the power of the same.</p>

  <p>And <i>First</i>, the Illustrious Lord of <i>Verulam</i>, in his
  <i>History of Life and Death</i>, Histor. 6. §. 3. observes, That
  <i>Motion</i> and <i>Warmth</i> (of which two, <i>Friction</i> consists)
  draws forth, into the parts, New Juyce and Vigour. And <i>Canon.</i>
  XIII. he affirms, That <i>Frictions</i> conduce much to <i>Longevity</i>.
  See the same, <i>Connex.</i> ix. §. 26. <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

  <p><i>Secondly</i>, The Honourable <i>Robert Boyle</i>, in his
  <i>Usefulness of Experimental Philosophy</i>, <i>sect</i> 2. <i>ch.</i>
  15. considering the Body of a Living man or any Animal, as an Engine, so
  composed, that there is a conspiring communication betwixt its parts, by
  vertue whereof a very slight impression of adventitious matter upon some
  one part, may be able to work, on some other distant part, or perhaps on
  the whole Engine, a change far exceeding, what the same adventitious
  matter could do upon a Body not so contrived: Representing, I say, an
  Animal in this manner, and thence inferring, how it may be alter'd for
  the better or worse by motions or impulses, confessedly
  <i>Mechanicall</i>, observes, How some are recover'd from swouning fits
  by pricking; others grow faint and do vomit by the bare motion of a
  Coach; others fall into a troublesome sickness by the agitation of a
  Ship, and by the Sea-air (whence they recover by rest, and by going a
  shore.) Again, how in our Stables a Horse well-curried is half-fed: How
  some can tell by the Milk of their Asses, whether that day they have been
  well curried or not: Arguing hence, that if in <i>Milk</i> the alteration
  is so considerable, it should be so likewise in the <i>Blood</i>, or
  other Juyces, of which the Blood is elaborated, and consequently in
  divers of the principal parts of the Body. Where also (upon the authority
  of <i>Piso</i>) he refers the Reader to the <i>Brasilian</i> Empiricks,
  whose <!-- Page 208 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page208"></a>{208}</span>wild <i>Frictions</i>, as unskilfully as
  they order them, do strange things, both in <i>preserving health</i>, and
  <i>curing diseases</i>; curing Cold and <i>Chronical</i> ones by
  <i>Friction</i>, as they do <i>Acute</i> ones, by <i>Unction</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Thirdly</i>, The learned Dr. <i>John Beale</i>, did not long since
  communicate by some Letters; <i>First</i>, that he could make good proof
  of the curing or killing a very great and dangerous <i>Wen</i> (that had
  been very troublesome for two or three years,) by the application of a
  dead mans hand, whence the Patient felt such a cold stream pass to the
  Heart, that it did almost cause in him a fit of swouning.
  <i>Secondly</i>, that, upon his brothers knowledge, a certain Cook in a
  Noble Family of <i>England</i> (wherein that brother of his then lived)
  having been reproached for the ugliness of his <i>Warty</i> hands, and
  return'd for answer, that he had tried many remedies, but found none, was
  bid by his Lord, to rub his hand with that of a dead man; and that this
  Lord dying soon after, the Cook made use both of his Lords advise and
  hand, and speedily found good effect. (Which is also confirm'd by what
  Mr. <i>Boyle</i> relates in his lately mentioned <i>Book</i>, of Dr.
  <i>Harvey's</i> frequently succesfull triall, of curing some Tumors or
  Excrescencies, by holding on them such a Hand.) Here is <i>Friction</i>
  or <i>Touch</i>, to mortifie Wens, to drive away swellings and
  Excrescencies: And why not to repell or dissipate Spirits, that may have
  a dangerous influence upon the Brain, or other parts; as well as to call
  forth the retired ones into the habit of the Body, for Invigoration?
  <i>Thirdly</i>, that a Gentleman, who came lately out of <i>Ireland</i>,
  lay at his House, and inform'd him of an aged Knight there, who having
  great pain in his feet, insomuch that he was unable to use them,
  suffered, as he was going to bed, a loving <i>Spaniell</i> to lick his
  feet; which was for the present very pleasing to him, so that he used it
  mornings and evenings, till he found the pain appeased, and the use of
  his feet restored. This, saith <!-- Page 209 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page209"></a>{209}</span>the <i>Relater</i>, was a gentle touch,
  and transpiration; for he found the Spirits transpire with a pleasing
  Kind of Titillation. <i>Fourthly</i>, that he can assure of an honest
  Blacksmith, who by his healing hand converted his Barrs of Iron into
  Plates of Silver; and had this particular faculty, that he caused
  Vomitings by stroaking the Stomack; gave the Stool by stroaking the
  Belly; appeased the Gout, and other paines, by stroaking the parts
  affected.</p>

<h3><i>Some particulars, communicated from forraign parts,
concerning the Permanent </i>Spott<i> in </i>Jupiter<i>; and
a Contest between two Artists about </i>Optick Glasses<i>,
&amp;c.</i></h3>

<div class="sidenoter"><i>See </i>Numb. 1<i>. of these </i>Transactions<i>; by the date whereof it will appeare, that that </i>Spot<i> was observed in </i>England<i>, a good while before any such thing was so much as heard of.</i></div>
  <p><i>Eustachio de Divinis</i> (saith the <i>Informer</i>,) has written a
  large Letter, wherein he pretends, that the Permanent Spot in
  <i>Jupiter</i> hath been first of all discovered with <i>his</i> Glasses;
  and that the P. <i>Gotignies</i> is the first that hath thence deduced
  the Motion of <i>Jupiter</i> about his <i>Axis</i>; and that Signior
  <i>Cassini</i> opposed it at first; to whom the said <i>Gotignies</i>
  wrote a letter of complaint thereupon.</p>

  <p>The same <i>Eustachio</i> pretends likewise, that his great Glasses
  excell those of <i>Campani</i>; and that in all the tryals, made with
  them, they have performed better; and that <i>Campani</i> was not willing
  to do, what was necessary for well comparing the one with the other.
  <i>viz.</i> To put equall <i>Eye-glasses</i> in them, or to exchange the
  same Glasses.</p>

  <p>The said <i>Divini</i> affirms also, that he hath found a way to <!--

  whether an Object glass be good or not, onely by looking upon it, without
  trying. This would be of good use, especially if it should extend so far
  as to discerne the goodness of such a glass, whilst it is yet on the
  Cement.</p>

<h3><i>An Account
of Dr. </i>Sydenham's<i> Book, entituled, </i>Methodus Curandi
Febres, Propriis observationibus superstructa<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>This <i>Book</i> undertakes to deliver a more certain and more genuine
  Method of curing Feavers and Agues, than has obtained hitherto: And it
  being premised, <i>First</i>, that a Fever is Natures Engine, she brings
  into the field, to remove her enemy; or her handmaid, either for
  evacuating the impurities of the blood, or for reducing it into a New
  State: <i>Secondly</i>, that the true and genuine cure of this sickness
  consists in such a tempering of the Commotion of the Blood, that it may
  neither exceed, nor be too languide: This, I say, being premised by the
  Author, he informs the Reader;</p>

  <p>In the <i>First Section</i>, of the different Method, to be employed
  in the cure of Feavers, not only in respect of the differing
  constitutions and ages of the patients, but also in regard of the
  differing seasons of one and the same year, and of the difference of one
  year from another. As to the <i>Former</i>, he shews, in what sorts of
  <i>Patients</i>, and at what time of the Feaver, Phlebotomy, or Vomiting,
  or both, are to be used; and when and where not: In what space of time
  the <i>Depuration</i> if nature be not disturbed or hindred in her work,
  will be perform'd: When <i>Purgatives</i> are to be administred: How that
  <i>Diarrhea's</i> happen, if the <i>Patient</i> had in the <!-- Page 211
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page211"></a>{211}</span>beginning of
  the Feaver an inclination to vomit, but no vomit was given; and that
  those symptoms, which commonly are imputed to a malignity, do, for the
  most part, proceed from the Relaxation of the tone of the Bloud, caused
  by Medicines too refrigerating, or by the unseasonable use of Glisters in
  the declination of the disease. As to the <i>Latter</i>, he observes,
  that one of the chief causes, rendring the Cure of Feavers so uncertain
  and unsuccessfull, is, that <i>Practitioners</i> do accommodate their
  observations, they take from the successful cure of some Feavers in one
  season or the year, or in some one year, to that of all Feavers in any
  season, or in any year whatsoever. And here he observes, <i>first</i>,
  how vigorous the blood is in the <i>Spring</i>, and how dispirited in
  <i>Autumn</i>; and thence regulates the letting of bloud, and Vomiting,
  and the giving of Glisters. <i>Next</i>, how difficult it is, to assign
  the cause of the difference between the Feavers of <i>Several years</i>;
  and to prognosticate of the salubrity or insalubrity of the following
  part of the year: where yet he insinuates, that, when <i>Insects</i> do
  swarm extraordinarily, and when Feavers and Agues (especially
  <i>Quartans</i>) appear very early, as about <i>Midsummer</i>, then
  <i>Autumn</i> commonly proves very sickly. <i>Lastly</i>, what method and
  Cautions are to be used in the Cure of <i>Epidemical</i> Feavers.</p>

  <p>In the <i>Second Section</i>, he treats of the <i>Symptoms</i>,
  accompanying <i>Continued</i> Feavers; as <i>Phrensies</i>,
  <i>Pleurisies</i>, <i>Coughs</i>, <i>Hicoughs</i>, <i>Fluxes</i>,
  <i>&amp;c.</i> Shewing, both whence they are caused, and how they are to
  be cured: Where having inserted a considerable <i>Paragraph</i>, touching
  a certain <i>Symptomatical</i> Feaver in the <i>Spring</i>, to be cured
  like Plurisies; he mentions among many Observables, this, as a chief one,
  that <i>Laudanum</i>, or any other <i>Narcotick</i> given against the
  <i>Phrensy</i>, in the beginning, progress, or height of a Feaver, does
  rather hurt, than good, but in the declination thereof, is used with good
  success. To all which he subjoins a particular <!-- Page 212 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page212"></a>{212}</span>accompt of the <i>Iliac
  Passion</i> (esteem'd by him to be sometimes a <i>Symptome</i> also of
  Feavers;) not only discoursing of its cause (a preposterous inversion of
  the Intestins, proceeding either from Obstruction, or Irritation,) but
  adding also a very plain way of Curing the same; and that not by the use
  of <i>Quick-silver</i> or <i>Bullets</i> (by him judged to be frequently
  noxious) but only by <i>Mint-water</i>; and the application of a Whelp to
  the Patients stomach; to strengthen the same, and to reduce it again to
  its natural motion.</p>

  <p>In the <i>Third Section</i>, he treats of <i>Intermittent</i> Feavers,
  or of <i>Agues</i>: Where he discourses of the times of the <i>Cold</i>
  and <i>Hot</i> fits, and of <i>that</i> of the <i>Separation</i> of the
  subdued aguish matter: Finds difficulty in giving a satisfactory accompt
  of the <i>return of Fits</i>: distinguishes Agues into <i>Vernal</i> and
  <i>Autumnal</i>: Takes notice, that as there are few <i>Continued</i>
  Feavers, so generally there are only <i>Quotidians</i> and
  <i>Tertians</i>, in the <i>Spring</i>; and only <i>Tertians</i> and
  <i>Quartans</i> in <i>Autumn</i>; Of which having offered Reasons, that
  seem considerable, he proceeds to his Method of curing them; and, laying
  much weight upon the said difference, he prescribes and urges different
  ways to be used in that cure: Interserting among other things these
  notes; <i>First</i>, that the Period of Fermentation in Feavers, both
  <i>Continued</i> and <i>Intermittent</i>, is (if left to Natures own
  conduct, and well regulated, if need be, by Art) perform'd in about 336.
  hours or 14 dayes, subducting in <i>Intermittent</i> ones, the hours of
  intermission, and counting 5½ hours for every Paroxism; and imputing the
  excursion beyond that time to the disturbance given to nature by the
  error of Practitioners. <i>Secondly</i>, that whoever hath had a
  <i>Quartan</i> formerly, though many years be pass'd, shall, if he chance
  to have another, be <i>soon</i> freed from it; and that a Physician
  knowing <i>that</i>, may confidently predict <i>this</i>. <!-- Page 213
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page213"></a>{213}</span></p>

  <p>In the <i>Fourth Section</i>, the Author, in conformity to the Custom
  of those that write of Feavers, discourses of the <i>Small-pox</i>; and
  <i>First</i>, examining the cause of this sickness and its universality,
  delivers his peculiar opinion of the bloud's endeavouring a Renovation or
  a New Texture (once at least in a Mans life) and is inclin'd to preferr
  the same to the received doctrine of its malignity. <i>Then</i>, having
  laid down, for a foundation of the Cure, the two times, of
  <i>Separation</i> and <i>Expulsion</i>, he argues as well against too
  high an Ebullition or too hasty a separation (by a hot diet or high
  Cordials) as against too languid a one (by Blooding, Purges, and Cooling
  medicines.) The like he does to the Time of <i>Expulsion</i>, forbidding
  <i>both</i> immoderate Heat (whereby Nature's expelling operation is
  disturbed by a precipitated and too thick a crowd of the protruded
  pustuls,) <i>and</i> too much Cooling, whereby due Expulsion is hindred.
  In short, he advises, to permit Nature to do her own work, requiring
  nothing of the Physician, but to regulate her, when she is exorbitant,
  and to fortifie her, when she is too weak. He concludes all, with
  delivering a Model of the Method, he would use for his own only Son, if
  he should fall into this Sickness.</p>

<h3><i>Certain </i>Problems<i>
touching some Points of </i>Navigation<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>These <i>Problems</i> are presented by the Learned and Industrious
  <i>Nicolaus Mercator</i>, for the advancing of that Excellent and
  Beneficial Science, <i>Navigation</i>, as follows:</p>

  <p>The line of <i>Artificial Tangents</i>, or the <i>Logarithmical
  Tangent-line</i>, beginning at 45 deg. and taking every half
  <i>degree</i> for a whole one, is found to agree pretty near with the
  <i>Meridian-line</i> of the <i>Sea-Charte</i>; they both growing, as it
  were, after the same Proportion. But the Table of <i>Meridional</i>
  degrees being calculated only to every <i>Sexagesimal</i> minute of a
  degree, shews some small difference from the said <i>Logarithmical
  Tangent-line</i>. Hence it may be doubted, whether that difference do not
  arise from that little errour, which is committed by calculating the
  Table of <i>Meridional</i> degrees <i>only</i> to every minute. <!-- Page
  216 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page216"></a>{216}</span></p>

  <p>Mr. <i>Oughtred</i> in the VI. <i>Chap.</i> of his <i>Navigation</i>,
  annexed to the Book, entituled, <i>The Circles of Proportion, and the
  Horizontal Instrument</i> &amp;c. mentions an Artifice, by himself
  discover'd, by which it may be effected, that the small Parts of the
  <i>Meridian</i> be not <i>one</i> minute (which on the face of the
  <i>Earth</i> answers to above an <i>English</i> Mile) but the
  hundred-thousanth, or, if need be, the millioneth part of a minute,
  scarce exceeding one fifteenth part of an Inch: Which thing, <i>he
  saith</i>, he is able to perform in <i>Tables</i> unto the <i>Radius</i>
  10000000; yet nothing at all differing either in their form or manner of
  working from those that are now commonly in use.</p>

  <p>But which way this is to be done, this <i>Author</i> hath not made
  known to the Publick. And, though such <i>Tables</i> unto the
  <i>Radius</i> 10000000, had been brought to light, yet would they not be
  sufficient to prove the identity or sameness of the said two Lines, as to
  continue the comparison between them as far, as the one of them,
  <i>videl.</i> the <i>Logarithmicall Tangent-line</i>, is already
  calculated, that is; to Ten places, besides the
  <i>Charactoristick</i>.</p>

  <p>Now therefore, if a certain Rule could be produced, by which the
  Agreement or Disagreement of the said two Lines might be shew'd, not only
  to that Extent of places, to which that <i>Tangent Line</i> is already
  calculated, but also to as many more, as the same may be yet further
  extended unto, in <i>infinitum usque</i>; surely that rule would not only
  save us the labour of making <i>Tables</i> unto the <i>Radius</i>
  10000000; but also the <i>Helix</i> or Spiral Line of the Ships Course
  would be reduced to a more precise exactness, than ever was pretended by
  Him: and this most Noble and Useful Science (as He justly calls it) which
  is the Bond of most disjunct Countries, and the Consociation of Nations
  farthest remote, would attain its full lustre and perfection.</p>

  <p>Besides, that the same Rule would also discover a far easier way of
  making <i>Logarithmes</i>, than ever was practised or known; and
  therefore might serve, when ever there should be occasion, to extend the
  <i>Logarithmes</i> beyond that number of places, that is already
  extant.</p>

  <p>Moreover such a rule would enable men to draw the <i>Meridian</i> line
  <i>geometrically</i>, that is, without <i>Tables</i> or <i>Scales</i>:
  which indeed <!-- Page 217 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page217"></a>{217}</span>might also be done, by setting of the
  <i>Secants</i> of every whole or half degree, if there were not this
  Inconveniency in it (which is not in my Rule:) That a Line composed of so
  many small parts, would be subject to many errours, especially in a small
  compass.</p>

  <p>The same Rule also will serve, to find the Course and Distance between
  two Places assigned, as far, as practice shall require it; and that,
  without any Table of <i>Meridional</i> parts, and yet with as much ease
  and exactness.</p>

  <p>And seeing all these things do depend on the solution of this
  Question, <i>Whether the Artificial Tangent-line be the true
  Meridian-line?</i> It is therefore, that I undertake, by God's
  assistance, to resolve the said Question. And to let the world know the
  readiness and confidence, I have to make good this undertaking, I am
  willing to lay a <i>Wager</i> against any one or more persons that have a
  mind to engage, for so much as <i>another Invention</i> of mine (which is
  of less subtlety, but of far greater benefit to the publick) may be worth
  to the Inventor.</p>

  <p>For, the great advantage, that all Merchants, Mariners, and
  consequently the Common-wealth, may receive from this <i>other
  Invention</i>, is, in my judgment, highly valuable; seeing it will
  oftentimes make a ship sail, though, according to the common way of
  sailing, the wind be quite contrary, and yet as near to the place
  intended, as if the wind had been favourable: Or, if you will, it will
  enable one to gain something in the intended way, whether the wind be
  good or no (except only when you go directly South or North) but the
  advantage will be most, where there is most need of it, that is, when the
  Wind is contrary: So that one may very often gain a fifth, fourth, third
  part, or more of the intended voyage; according as it is longer or
  shorter, <i>viz.</i> always more in a longer Voyage, where the gain is
  more considerable, and more welcome; not only by saving Time, but also
  Victuals, Water, Fuel, Mens health, and so much Room in the ship.</p>

  <p>All this, which is here pretended, the Proposer is to make good by the
  Verdict of some able Men, who also may give a guess, what this latter
  Invention may be worth to the owner: And for so much, and no more, he
  will stand engaged against <!-- Page 218 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page218"></a>{218}</span>any one or more Persons, that he will and
  shall resolve the <i>Question</i> above-mention'd, <i>viz. Whether the
  Artificial Tangent-line be the true Meridian-line, yea or no?</i> And if
  he do not, that then he will loose, and transport to the other Party the
  whole benefit of the last mentioned invention. But if, on the contrary,
  he do prove or disprove the Identity of the said two lines, to the
  Judgment of some able <i>Mathematicians</i>, That then so much money be
  paid him by the other Party, as the said Invention was valued.</p>

  <p>And, whereas there are often Wagers laid about things that concern the
  Engagers little or nothing; 'tis thought, that it would concern all
  Merchants, Mariners, and all Lovers of the common good, rather to lay
  wagers against one another about Things of this nature, where the Gainer
  doth gain as well, as if he had laid his wager about something else, and
  the Looser hath so far the benefit as well as the Gaine, That he seeth
  thereby promoted the thing, that concerns them both alike.</p>

  <p>Now therefore, to the end, that the Looser may have his benefit by it,
  as well as the Gainer, it would not be amiss, that the condition were
  made thus, that the latter should grant the moity of his gain to the
  Proposer; that thereby he might be enabled to bring to light both those,
  and some other useful inventions, for the Service of Mankind. And to
  manifest, that it is not for his own interest only, that the
  <i>Proposer</i> mentions this; he is willing to impart from that moity,
  so received, the full moity again to any other person within his
  Majesty's Dominions, who shall first of all give notice of his
  Undertaking to prove or disprove the said Identity, and perform it
  accordingly within the space of two Months, to be computed from the
  present Date. Those that have a mind to engage, may repair to the
  Printers of these <i>Tracts</i>, where they may know further.</p>

<h3><i>A new Contrivance of </i>Wheel-Barometer<i>, much more

Book.</i></h3>

  <p>This is only an easy way of applying an <i>Index</i> to any <i>Common
  Barascope</i>, whether the Glass be only a Single Cane, or have a round
  Bolthead at the top. And by the means thereof, the <!-- Page 219 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page219"></a>{219}</span>Variation of the
  Altitude of the <i>Mercurial</i> Cylinder, which at most is hardly three
  Inches, may be made as distinguishable, as if it were three Foot, or
  three Yards, or as much more, as is desired.</p>

  <p>The manner hereof is visible enough by <i>Figure</i> I: where A B C
  represents the Tube, which may be either Blunt, or with a Head, as A B C
  (by which latter shape, more room is allow'd for any remainder of Air, to
  expand the better.) This is to be filled with Quick-silver, and inverted
  as commonly; but into a Vessel of Stagnant Mercury, made after the
  fashion of I K, that is, having its sides about 3 or 4 inches high, and
  the Cavity of it equally big both above and below; and if it can be
  (besides that part, which is fill'd by the end of the <i>Mercurial</i>
  Tube, that stands in it) of equal capacity with the hollow of the Cane
  about B: For then the Quicksilver rising as much in the hollow of I, as
  it descends at B, the difference of the height in the Receiver I, will be
  just half the usual difference, And if the receiving Vessel I K have a
  bigger Cavity, the difference will be less, but if less, the difference
  will be greater: But, whether the difference be hereby made bigger or
  less, 'tis no great matter, since by the contrivance of the <i>Wheel</i>
  and <i>Index</i> (which is more fully described in the <i>Preface</i> to
  the <i>Micrography</i>) the least variation may be made as sensible as is
  desired, by diminishing the bigness of the Cylinder E, and lengthening
  the <i>Index</i> F G, according to the Proportion requisite.</p>

<h3><i>An Account of </i>Four Suns<i>, which very lately appear'd
in </i>France<i>, and of two </i>Raine-bows<i>, unusually
posited, seen in the same Kingdom, somewhat longer
agoe.</i></h3>

  <p>These <i>Phænomena</i> are thought worthy to be inserted here, for the
  Speculation of the Curious in those Kingdoms; as they were publisht in
  the French <i>Journal des Scavans</i>, of May 10, 1666. <i>viz.</i></p>

  <p>The 9th of <i>April</i> of this present year, about half an hour past
  nine, there appear'd three Circles in the Sky. <i>One</i> of them was
  very great, a little interrupted, and white every where, without <!--
  Page 220 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page220"></a>{220}</span>the
  mixture of any other colour. It passed through the midst of the Sun's
  <i>Disk</i>, and was parallel to the <i>Horizon</i>. Its <i>Diameter</i>
  was above a hundred degrees, and its <i>Center</i> not far from the
  <i>Zenith</i>.</p>

  <p>The <i>Second</i> was much less and defective in some places, having
  the Colours of a Rainbow, especially in that part, which was within the
  great Circle. It had the true Sun for its Center.</p>

  <p>The <i>Third</i> was less, than the first, but greater than the
  second; it was not entire, but only an Arch or Portion of a Circle, whose
  Center was far distant from that of the Sun, and whose circumference did,
  by its middle, join to that of the least Circle, intersecting the
  greatest Circle by its two extreams. In this Circle were discerned also
  the Colours of a Rainbow, but they were not so strong, as those of the
  <i>Second</i>.</p>

  <p>At the place, where the circumference of this <i>Third</i> Circle did
  close with that of the <i>Second</i>, there was a great brightness of
  Rainbow-Colours, mixt together: And at the two extremities, where this
  <i>Second</i> Circle intersected the <i>First</i>, appear'd two
  <i>Parhelia's</i> or Mock-suns; which shone very bright, but not so
  bright, nor were so well defined, as the true Sun. The False Sun, that
  was towards the <i>South</i>, was bigger, and far more luminous, than
  that towards the <i>East</i>. Besides those two <i>Parhelia's</i>, which
  were on the two sides of the true Sun, in the intersection of the
  <i>First</i> and <i>Third</i> Circle, there was also upon the
  <i>First</i> great Circle, a <i>third</i> Mock-sun, situated to the
  <i>North</i>, which was less and less bright, than the two others. So
  that at the same time there were seen <i>Four</i> Suns in the
  Heavens.</p>

  interrupted in some places.</i></p>

  <p>H D N. <i>A portion of a Circle, that was Excentrick to the Sun, and
  greater than the Circle</i> D E B O, <i>which touch'd</i> D E B O, <i>and

  the Colours of a Rainbow. The False Sun, mark'd</i> N, <i> was fainter
  than that, which is mark'd</i> H.</p>

  <p>C. <i>The Mock-Sun, all white, and far less shining, than the two
  others.</i></p>

  <p>I. <i>A space very dark betwixt</i> R. <i>and</i> D.</p>

<div class="sidenoter">* <i>Those </i>Five<i> Suns, that appear'd the 29 </i>March<i>, A. 1629. at </i>Rome<i>, between 2 or 3 of the Clock, in the afternoon, were thus posited; that the two of them, which were in the intersection of two Circles, appear'd in that of a Circle, which passed through the Sun's Diske, with another, that was </i>Concentrick<i> to the Sun: as may be seen in </i>Figure III<i>. borrow'd (for the easier comparing them together) out of </i>Des-Cartes<i> his </i>Meteors<i>, cap.

  <p>This Appearance is look't upon as one of the notablest, that can be
  seen, by reason of the <i>Excentricity</i> of the Circle H D N, and
  because that the <i>Parhelia</i> * were not in the Intersection of the
  Circle D E B O with the great Circle S C H N, but in that of the
  Semi-circle H D N.</p>

  <p>As for the two odd <i>Rainbows</i>; they appear'd at <i>Chartres</i>
  the 10. of <i>August</i>, 1665. about half an hour past six in the
  Evening; and did cross one another almost at right Angles, as may be seen
  by <i>Fig.</i> IV.</p>

  <div class="figleft" style="width:29%;">

      alt="Fig. IV." title="Fig. IV." /></a>
  </div>
  <p>The Rainbow, which was opposite to the Sun, in the usual manner, was
  more deeply colour'd, than that, which cross'd it; though even the
  Colours of the first <i>Iris</i> were not so strong, as they are now and
  then seen at other times.</p>

  <p>The greatest height of the stronger Rainbow, was about 45. degrees;
  the feebler Rainbow lost one of its Legs, by growing fainter, about 20
  degrees above the stronger; and the Leg below appear'd continued to the
  <i>Horizon</i>.</p>

  <p>These Rainbows did not <i>Just</i> decussate one another at right
  Angles; there was some 6 or 7 degrees difference. The fainter, seem'd to
  be a Portion of a great Circle; and the stronger was but a Portion of a
  small Circle, as usually.</p>

  <p>The Sun, at their appearance, was about 6 degrees high above the
  <i>Horizon</i>, and towards the 17 <i>Azimuth</i> of the West,
  Northward.</p>

  <p>The Observer, M. <i>Estienne</i>, notes, that, when he made this
  Observation, the River of <i>Chartres</i>, which runs very near from
  <i>South</i> to <i>North</i>, was betwixt him and the Rainbow; and that
  he stood Level with this River, whence he was distant not above 150
  paces: which he adds, that the Curious may the better judge of this
  Observation.</p>

<h3><i>A Relation of an Accident by Thunder and Lightning,
at </i>Oxford<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>This was imparted by Dr. <i>Wallis</i> in a Letter, written at
  <i>Oxford</i>, May 12, 1666. to the <i>Publisher</i>, as follows:</p>

  <p>I should scarce have given you so soon the trouble of another Letter,
  were it not for an Accident which hapn'd here <i>May</i> 10. I had that
  afternoon, about 4 of the clock heard it thunder at some distance. About
  5 of the clock the Thunder coming nearer to us; it began to rain, and
  soon after (the rain withal increasing) the Thunder grew very loud, and
  frequent, and with long ratling Claps (though not altogether so great, as
  I have some other times heard:) and the Lightning with flashes very
  bright (notwithstanding the clear day-light) and very frequent, (when at
  the fastest, scarce a full minute between one flash and another; many
  times not so much, but a second flash before the Thunder of the former
  was heard:) The Thunder for the most part began to be heard about 8 or 10
  second minutes after the flash; as I observ'd for a great part of the
  time by my Minute-Watch: but once or twice I observ'd it to follow (in a
  manner) immediately upon it, as it were in the same moment; and the
  lightning extream red and fiery. I do not use to be much apprehensive of
  Thunder and Lightning, but I was at this time (I know not well, why?)
  very apprehensive, more than ordinary, of mischief to be done by it, for
  it seem'd to me to be very low and near us (which made me so particular,
  as to observe the distance of the flash by the noise) and very frequent,
  and bright, so that, had it been by night as it was by day, it would have
  been very terrible. And, though I kept within doors, yet I sensibly
  discover'd a stinking sulphureous smell in the Air. About 7 of the clock
  it ended, before which time I had news brought me of a Sad Accident upon
  the <!-- Page 223 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page223"></a>{223}</span>water at <i>Medley</i> about a Mile or
  somewhat more distant from hence. Two Schollars of
  <i>Wadham</i>-Colledge, being alone in a Boat (without a Water-man)
  having newly thrust off from shore, at <i>Medley</i>, to come homewards,
  standing near the Head of the Boat, were presently with a stroke of
  Thunder or Lightning, both struck off out of the Boat into the Water, the
  one of them stark dead, in whom, though presently taken out of the Water
  (having been by relation, scarce a minute in it) there was not discerned
  any appearance of life, sense, or motion: the other was stuck fast in the
  Mud (with his Feet downwards, and his upper parts above water) like a
  post not able to help himself out; but, besides a present stonying or
  numness, had no other hurt; but was for the present so disturb'd in his
  senses, as that he knew not, how he came there out of the Boat, nor could
  remember either Thunder or Lightning, that did effect it: and was very
  feeble and faint upon it; which (though presently put into a warm Bed) he
  had not thoroughly recover'd by the next Night; and whether since he have
  or no, I know not.</p>

  <p>Others in another Boat, about 10 or 20 yards from these (as by their
  description I estimate) felt a disturbance and shaking in their Boat, and
  one of them had his Chair struck from under him, and thrown upon him; but
  had no hurt. Those immediately made up to the others, and (some leaping
  into the Water to them) presently drew them either into the Boat or on
  Shore; yet none of them saw these two fall into the Water (not looking
  that way) but heard one of them cry out for help presently upon the
  stroke, and smelt a strange stinking smell in the Air; which, when I
  asked him, that told it me, what kind of stink? he said, like such a
  smell, as is perceived upon the stricking of Flints together.</p>

  <p>He that was dead (when by putting into a warm Bed, and rubbing, and
  putting strong waters into his Mouth, &amp;c. no life could be brought
  into him) was the next morning brought to town; where, among the
  multitudes of others, who came to see, Dr. <i>Willis</i>, Dr.
  <i>Mellington</i>, Dr. <i>Lower</i>, and my self, with some others, went
  to view the Corps: where we found no wound at all in the skin, the face
  and neck swart and black, but not more, than might be ordinary, by the
  settling of the blood: On the right side of the neck was a little
  blackish spot about an inch long, and <!-- Page 224 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page224"></a>{224}</span>about a quarter of an
  inch broad at the broadest, and was, as if it had been sear'd with a hot
  iron; and, as I remember, one somewhat bigger on the left side of the
  neck, below the Ear. Streight down the breast, but towards the left side
  of it, was a large place about three quarters of a Foot in length, and
  about two inches in breadth, in some places more, in some less, which was
  burnt and hard, like Leather burnt with the fire, of a deep blackish red
  Colour, not much unlike the scorch'd skin of a rosted Pig. And on the
  fore-part of the left Shoulder such another spot about as big as a
  Shilling; but that in the neck was blacker and seem'd more sear'd. From
  the top of the right shoulder, sloping downwards towards that place in
  his Breast, was a narrow Line of the like scorched skin; as if somewhat
  had come in there at the neck, and had run down to the breast, and there
  spread broader.</p>

  <p>The buttons of his <i>Doublet</i> were most of them off; which, some
  thought might have been torn off with the blast, getting in at the neck,
  and then bursting its way out: for which the greatest presumption was (to
  me) that, besides 4 or 5 buttons wanting towards the bottom of the
  Breast, there were about half a dozen together clear off from the bottom
  of the collar downwards, and I do not remember, that the rest of the
  buttons seem to be near worn out, but almost new. The collar of his
  doublet just over the fore-part of the left shoulder was quit broken
  asunder, cloth and stiffening, streight downwards, as if cut or chop'd
  asunder, but with a <i>Blunt</i> tool; only the inward linnen or fustian
  lineing of it was whole, by which, and by the view of the ragged Edges,
  it seem'd manifest to me, that it was by the stroak inward (from without)
  not outwards from within.</p>

  <p>His <i>Hat</i> was strangely torn, not just on the Crown, but on the
  side of the hat, and on the brim. On the side of it was a great hole,
  more than to put in ones fist through it: some part of it being quite
  struck away, and from thence divers gashes every way, as if torn, or cut
  with a <i>Dull</i> tool, and some of them of a good length, almost quite
  to the edges of the brim. And, beside these, one or two gashes more,
  which did not communicate with the hole in the side. This also I judged
  by a stroke inwards; not so much from the view of the edges of those
  gashes (from which there was scarce any judgement to be made either way)
  but <!-- Page 225 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page225"></a>{225}</span>because the lining was not torn, only ript
  off from the edge of the hat (where it was sow'd on) on that side, where
  the hole was made. But his hat not being found upon his head, but at some
  distance from him, it did not appear, against what part of the head that
  hole was made.</p>

  <p>Upon the rest of his Cloaths, I do not know of any further effect, nor
  did we smell any sulphurous scent about them: which might be,
  <i>Partly</i> because it was now a good while after the time, and
  <i>Partly</i> by reason of their being presently drenched in the water
  into which he fell.</p>

  <p>The night following, the three <i>Doctors</i> above mentioned, and my
  self, with some Chirurgions (besides a multitude of others) were present
  at the opening of the head, to see if any thing could be there
  discover'd; but there appear'd no sign of contusion; the brain full and
  in good order; the nerves whole and sound, the vessels of the brain
  pretty full of Blood. But nothing was by any of them discern'd to be at
  all amiss. But it was by candle-light, and they had not time to make very
  nice Observations of it (the Body being to be buried by and by) and the
  croud of People was a further hindrance. But if any thing had been
  considerably out of order to the view, it would surely have been by some
  of them discover'd. Some of them thought, they discern'd a small fissure
  or crack in the skull; and some who held it, while it was sawing off,
  said, they felt it Jarring in their hands, and there seem'd to the eye
  something like it, but it was so small, as that by candle-light we could
  not agree it certainly so to be.</p>

  <p>Some of the <i>Hair</i> on the right Temple was manifestly singed, or
  burnt; and the lower part of that Ear blacker, than the parts about it,
  but soft; and it might be only the settling of the Blood. The upper part
  of the left shoulder, and that side of the neck, were also somewhat
  blacker than the rest of the Body, but whether it were by the blow, which
  broke the collar, and scorch'd the round red spot thereupon, or only by
  settling of the Blood, I cannot say; yet I think, it might very well be,
  that both on the head, and on this side of the neck, there might be a
  very great blow, and a contusion upon it (and seems to have been so, by
  the tearing of the hat, and breaking the collar, if not also cracking of
  the skull) and yet no sign of such contusion, because dying so
  immediately, there was not time for the Blood to gather <!-- Page 226
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page226"></a>{226}</span>to the part
  and stagnate there (which in bruises is the cause of blackness) and it
  was but as if such a blow had been given on a Body newly dead; which does
  not use to cause such a symptom of a bruise, after the Blood ceases to
  circulate.</p>

  <p>Having done with, the Head, they open'd the <i>Breast</i>, and found
  that burning to reach quite through the skin, which was in those scorch'd
  places hard and horney, and shrunk up, so as it was not so thick as the
  soft skin about it: but no appearance of any thing deeper than the skin;
  the Muscles not at all disorder'd or discolour'd (perhaps, upon the
  reason, that was but now said of the Head, Neck and Shoulder). Having
  then taken off the <i>Sternum</i>, the Lungs and Heart appear'd all well,
  and well-colour'd without any disorder.</p>

  <p>This is the sum of what was observ'd; only that the whole Body was, by
  night, very much swell'd, more than in the morning; and smelt very strong
  and offensively: Which might be by the hotness of the weather, and by the
  heat of the place occasion'd by the multitude of People.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<h3><i>An Experiment
to examine, what </i>Figure<i>, and </i>Celerity<i> of </i>Motion<i>
begetteth, or encreaseth </i>Light<i> and </i>Flame<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>This was communicated by Dr. <i>Beale</i>, as follows;</p>

  <p><i>May</i> 5. 1665. fresh Mackrels were boyl'd in Water, with salt and
  sweet herbs; and, when the Water was perfectly cold, the next morning,
  the Mackrels were left in the Water for pickle.</p>

  <p><i>May</i> 6. more fresh Mackrels were boyl'd in like Water; and
  <i>May</i> 7. both Water and Mackrels were put into the former Water,
  together with the former Mackrels. (Which circumstances I do
  particularize, because, whether, the mixture of the pickle of several
  ages, and a certain space of time, or whatever else was necessary, and
  wanting, the trial did not succeed with like effect at other times).</p>

  <p>But now on the next <i>Munday</i> (<i>May</i> 8). evening, the Cook
  stirring the Water, to take out some of the Mackrels, found the Water at
  the first motion become very luminous, and the Fish shining through the
  Water, as adding much to the Light, which the water yielded. The water by
  the mixture of Salt and Herbs, <!-- Page 227 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page227"></a>{227}</span>in the boyling, was of it self thick and
  rather blackish, than of any other clear colour: yet being stirr'd, it
  shin'd, and all the fish appear'd, more brightly luminous in their own
  shapes.</p>

  <p>Wherever the drops of this water (after it was stirr'd) fell on the
  Ground, or Benches, they shin'd: And the Children took drops in their
  hands, as broad as a penny, running with them about the house, and each
  drop, both near and at distance, seem'd by their shining as broad as a
  six pence, or a shilling, or broader.</p>

  <p>The Cook turn'd up the side of the Fish, which was lowest, and thence
  came no shining: and after the water was for some good time settled, and
  fully at rest, it did not shine at all.</p>

  <p>On <i>Tuesday</i> night (<i>May</i> 9). we repeated the same Trial,
  and found the same effects. The water, till it was stirr'd, gave no
  light, but was thick and dark, as we saw by day-light, and by
  candle-light. As soon as the Cook's hand was thrust into the water, it
  began to have a glimmering; but being gently stirr'd by the hand moving
  round (as the Dairy-maid do to gather the Curds for Cheese) it did so
  shine, that they, who look'd on it at some distance, from the farther end
  of another room, thought verily, it was the shining of the Moon through a
  Window upon a Vessel of Milk; and by brisker Circulation it seem'd to
  flame.</p>

  <p>The Fish did then shine as well from the Inside, as the Outside, and
  chiefly from the Throat, and such places, as seem'd a little broken in
  the boyling.</p>

  <p>I took a piece that shin'd most, and fitted it as well as I could
  devise in the night, both to my great <i>Microscope</i>, and afterwards
  to my little one; but I could discern no light by any of these Glasses;
  nor from any drops of the shining water, when put into the Glasses. And
  <i>May</i> 10. in the brightest rayes of the Sun, I examin'd, in my great
  <i>Microscope</i>, a small broken piece of the Fish, which shin'd most
  the night before. We could find nothing on the surface of the Fish very
  remarkable. It seem'd whitish, and in a manner dried, with deep
  inequalities. And others, as well as my self, thought, we saw a stream,
  rather darkish, than luminous, arising like a very small dust from the
  Fish: And rarely here and there, a very small; and almost imperceptible
  sparkle in the Fish. Yet of these <i>sparkles</i> we are <i>certain</i>;
  we numbered them, and agreed in the number, order and place. Of the
  <i>steam</i> I am not confident, but do suspect our Eyes in the <!-- Page
  228 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page228"></a>{228}</span>bright
  Sun, or that it might be some dust in the Aire.</p>

  <p>The great <i>Microscope</i> being fitted in the day-light for this
  piece of Fish, we examin'd it that night, and it yielded no light at all,
  either by the view of the Glass, or otherwise.</p>

  <p>Finding it dry, I thought that the moisture of Spittle, and touching
  of it, might cause it to shine: and so it did, though but a very little,
  in a few small sparks, which soon extinguish'd. This we saw with the bare
  eye; not in the Glass.</p>

  <p>The Fish were not yet fetide, nor insipid to the best discerning
  palats: And I caused two Fish to be kept for further Tryal, two or three
  days longer, till they were fetide in very hot weather; and then I
  expected more brightness, but could find none, either in the water, by
  stirring it, or in the Fish, taken out of the water.</p>

  <p>And some Trials I made afterwards with other boyl'd Mackrels (as is
  above said) with like pickle, but failed of the like success.</p>

  <p>This season serves for many Trials in this kind, and by <span
  class="correction" title="Original reads `bet-bet' across line-break.."
  >better</span> <i>Microscopes</i>, or better ordered. And in these
  Vulgarities we may perhaps as well trace out the cause and nature of
  Light, as in Jewels of greatest value, &amp;c.</p>

<h3><i>Some Considerations
touching a Letter in the </i>Journal des Scavans<i> of
</i>May 24. 1666<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>In <i>Num.</i> 9. of these <i>Transactions</i> were publish'd the
  <i>Schemes</i> and <i>Descriptions</i> of certain Ways of <i>Sounding the
  Depth of the Sea without a Line</i>; and of <i>Fetching up Water from the
  bottom of it</i>; together with some Experiments already made with the
  former of these two Contrivances. The Author of the French <i>Journal des
  Scavans</i> found good, to insert them both in his <i>Journal</i> of
  <i>May</i> 3. but in another of <i>May</i> 24. intimates, that the said
  <i>Schemes</i> and their <i>Descriptions</i> are not very clear and
  intelligible (he means, that they were not well understood by
  <i>French</i> Readers) proposing also some Difficulties, relating to that
  Subject, and esteemed by him necessary to be satisfied, before any use
  could be made of the said Instruments.</p>

  <p>Upon this occasion, the Author of these <i>Tracts</i> thinks fit, here
  to represent, <!-- Page 229 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page229"></a>{229}</span></p>

  <p><i>First</i>, That <i>Englishmen</i> and such others, as are well
  versed in the <i>English</i> tongue, find no difficulty in understanding
  the descriptions of these <i>Engines</i>, nor in apprehending their
  structure, exhibited by the <i>Figures</i>, especially if notice be taken
  of the Emendation, expressed at the end of <i>Num.</i> 10. about the
  misgraving the <i>Bended end</i> of the <i>Springing Wire</i> (which it
  seems has not been noted in <i>France</i>, tho' the said <i>Num.</i> 10
  is known to have been seen there a pretty while before their
  <i>Journal</i> of <i>May</i> 24. was publish'd). And as for the
  particular of the <i>Bucket</i>, fetching water from the bottom of the
  Sea, both the <i>Figure</i> and the annexed <i>Description</i> thereof
  are so plain and clear, that 'tis some wonder here, that any difficulty
  of understanding them is pretended by any, that hath but ordinary skill
  in <i>Cutts</i> and the <i>English</i> language. Mean while, that way,
  which the <i>French</i> Author recommends for this purpose as more
  simple, <i>Videl. a Brass-Pump with double Valves</i>, is not at all
  unknown in <i>England</i>, nor has bin left untried there; but was found
  inconvenient, in respect that the Valves in descending did not fully
  open, and give the water a free passage through the Cavity of the Vessel,
  nor in ascending shut so close, as to hinder the water from coming in at
  the top: Whereas by the way proposed in <i>Num.</i> 9. both is perform'd
  with great ease and security.</p>

  <p><i>Secondly</i>, Whereas the <i>French</i> Author is of opinion, that
  'tis unknown, how much time a Heavy Body requires to sink in water,
  according to a certain depth; he may please to take notice, that that
  hath been made out in <i>England</i> by frequent Experiments; by which,
  several Depths, found by this Method of sounding <i>without</i> a Line,
  were examin'd by trying them over again in <i>the same</i> place
  <i>with</i> a Line, after the common way. And as to that <i>Quære</i> of
  his, Whether a heavy Body descends in the same <i>Proportion</i> of
  swiftness in <i>Water</i>, that it would do in <i>Air</i>? The Answer is,
  that it does not; but that, after it is sunk one or two fathoms into the
  Water, it has there arrived to its greatest swiftness, and keeps, after
  that, an equal degree of velocity; the <i>Resistance</i> of the water
  being then found equal to the <i>Endeavour</i> of the heavy Body
  downwards.</p>

  <p><i>Thirdly</i>, When the same <i>Author</i> alledges that it must be
  known, when a Light Body reascends from the bottom of the water to <!--
  Page 230 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page230"></a>{230}</span>the
  top, in what proportion of time and swiftness it rises. He seems not to
  have considered, that in this Experiment, the times of the descent and
  assent are both taken and computed together; so that for this purpose,
  there needs not that nicety, he discourses of.</p>

  <p><i>Fourthly</i>, Whereas it is further excepted, That this way of
  Sounding Depths is no new Invention; The answer is ready, that neither is
  it pretended to be so, in the often quoted <i>Tract</i>; it being only
  intimated there, that the manner of performing it, as it is in that place
  represented and described, is new.</p>

  <p><i>Lastly</i>, To rectifie the said Author's mistake, as if the
  instrument of fetching up Water from the bottom of the Sea, were chiefly
  contriv'd, to find out, Whether in some places of the Sea any
  <i>Sweet</i> Water is to be met with at the bottom: There will need no
  more, than to direct him to the Book it self <i>Num.</i> 9. where p. <a
  href="#page149">149</a>. towards the end, the <i>First</i> use of this
  <i>Bucket</i> is express'd to be, to know the <i>degrees of Saltness</i>
  of the Water according to its nearness to the top or bottom; or rather to
  know the constitution of the Sea-water in several depths of several
  <i>Climates</i>, which is a matter, much better to be found out by
  <i>Trial</i>, than <i>Discourse</i>. Neither is it any where argued in
  that Book (as the <i>French Journal</i> insinuates) that, because sweet
  water is found at the Bottom of the Sea of <i>Baharem</i>, therefore it
  <i>must</i>, but only that it <i>may</i>, be found so elsewhere. And
  since the same <i>Journal</i> admits, that those Sweet water-springs,
  which yield the sweet water, that is found at the said place, have been
  formerly on the <i>Continent</i>, far enough from the Sea, which hath
  afterwards covered them. It will be, it is presumed, lawful to ask, Why
  in many other places there may not be found the like? And besides, how we
  do know, but that there may be in other parts, Eruptious of large Springs
  at the bottom of the Sea, as well as there?</p>

  <p>As for the <i>New</i> kind of <i>Baroscopes</i>, which, not long agoe,
  * I intimated to you, that my haste would not permit me to give you an
  account off; since your Letters acquaint me, that you still design a
  Communicating to the <!-- Page 232 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page232"></a>{232}</span>Curious as much Information, as may be, in
  reference to <i>Baroscopes</i>; I shall venture to send you some Account
  of what I did but name (in my former Letter) to you.</p>

<div class="sidenoter">* <i>The Scales here meant were before competent Eyewitnesses made to turn manifestly with the thousandth part of a grain.</i></div>
  <p>Though by a Passage, you may meet with in the 19th and 20th Pages of
  my <i>Thermometrical Experiments and Thoughts</i>, you may find, that I
  did some years agoe think upon this New kind of Baroscope; yet the
  Changes of the Atmosphere's Weight not happening to be then such, as I
  wish'd, and being unwilling to deprive my self of all other use of the
  exactest Ballance *, that I (or perhaps any man) ever had, I confess to
  you, that successive avocations put this attempt for two or three years
  out of my thoughts; till afterwards returning to a place, where I chanc'd
  to find two or three pairs of Scales, I had left there, the sight of them
  brought it into my mind; and though I were then unable to procure
  exacter, yet my desire to make the Experiment some amends for so long a
  neglect, put me upon considering, that if I provided a
  <i>Glass-buble</i>, more than ordinary large and light, even such
  Ballances, as those, might in some measure perform, what I had tried with
  the strangely nice ones above-mention'd.</p>

  <p>I caused then to be blown at the Flame of a Lamp some
  <i>Glass-bubles</i> as large, thin and light, as I could then procure,
  and choosing among them, one, that seem'd the least unfit for my turn, I
  counterpoised it in a pair of Scales, that would loose their
  <i>Æquilibrium</i> with about the 30th part of a Grain, and were
  suspended at a Frame. I placed both the Ballance and the Frame by a good
  Baroscope, from whence I might learn the present weight of the
  Atmosphere. Then leaving these Instruments together; though the Scales,
  being no nicer than I have express'd, were not able to shew me all the
  Variations of the Air's weight that appear'd in the <i>Mercurial</i>
  Baroscope, yet they did what I expected, by shewing me variations no
  greater, than alter'd the height of Quicksilver half a quarter of an
  Inch, and perhaps much smaller than those: Nor did I doubt, that, if I
  had had either tender Scales, or the means of supplying the experiment
  with convenient accommodations, I should have <!-- Page 233 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page233"></a>{233}</span>discerned far smaller
  Alterations of the Weight of the Air, since I had the pleasure to see the
  Buble sometimes in an <i>æquilibrium</i> with the counterpoise;
  sometimes, when the Atmosphere was high, preponderate so manifestly, that
  the Scales being gently stirr'd, the Cock would play altogether on that
  side, at which the Buble was hung; and at other times (when the Air was
  heavier) that, which was at the first but the Counterpoise, would
  preponderate, and, upon the motion or the Ballance, make the Cock vibrate
  altogether on its side. And this would continue sometimes many daies
  together, if the Air so long retain'd the same measure of gravity; and
  then (upon other changes) the Buble would regain an <i>æquilibrium</i>,
  or a preponderance; so that I had oftentimes the satisfaction, by looking
  first upon the <i>Statical</i> Baroscope (as for distinctions sake it may
  be call'd) to foretell, whether in the <i>Mercurial</i> Baroscope the
  Liquor were high or low. Which Observations though they hold as well in
  Winter, and several times in Summer (for I was often absent during that
  season) as the Spring, yet the frequency of their Vicissitudes (which
  perhaps was but accidental) made them more pleasant in the latter of
  these seasons.</p>

  <p>So that, the matter of Fact having been made out by variety of
  repeated Observations, and by sometimes comparing severall of those new
  <i>Baroscopes</i> together, I shall add some of those Notes about this
  Instrument, which readily occur to my memory, reserving the rest till
  another opportunity.</p>

  <p>And <i>First</i>, if the ground, on which I went in framing this
  <i>Baroscope</i>, be demanded, the answer in short may be; 1. That,
  though the Glass-buble, and the Glass-counterpoise, at the time of their
  first being weigh'd, be in the Air, wherein they both are weigh'd,
  exactly of the same weight; yet they are nothing near of the same bulk;
  the Buble, by reason of its capacious cavity (which contains nothing but
  Air, or something that weighs less than Air) being perhaps a hundred or
  two hundred times (for I have not conveniency to measure them) bigger
  than the Metalline counterpoise. 2. That according to a
  <i>Hydrostatical</i> Law (which you know I have lately had occasion to
  make out) If two Bodies of equal gravity, but unequal bulk come to be
  weigh'd in another <i>Medium</i>, they will be no longer <!-- Page 234
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page234"></a>{234}</span>equiponderant;
  but if the new <i>Medium</i> be heavier, the greater Body, as being
  lighter in <i>Specie</i>, will loose more of its weight, than the lesser
  and more compact; but if the new <i>Medium</i> be lighter than the first,
  then the bigger Body will outweigh the lesser; And this disparity,
  arising from the change of <i>Medium's</i>, will be so much the greater,
  by how much the greater inequality of bulk there is between the Bodies
  formerly equiponderant. 3. That, laying these two together, I consider'd,
  that 'twould be all one, as to the effect to be produced, whether the
  Bodies were weighed in <i>Mediums</i> of differing gravity, or in the
  same <i>Medium</i>, in case its (<i>specifick</i>) gravity were
  considerably alter'd: And consequently, that since it appear'd by the
  <i>Baroscope</i>, that the weight of the Air was sometimes heavier, and
  sometimes lighter, the alterations of it, in point of gravity, from the
  weight, it was off at first counterpoising of the Buble of it, would
  <i>unequally</i> affect so large and hollow a Body, as the Buble, and so
  small and dense a one, as a Metallin weight: And when the Air by an
  increase of gravity should become a heavier <i>Medium</i>, than before,
  it would buoy up the Glass more than the Counterpoise; and if it grew
  lighter, than it was at first, would suffer the former to preponderate:
  (The Illustrations and Proof can scarce be added in few words; but, if it
  be desired, I may, God permitting, send you them at my next leasure:) And
  though our English Air be about a thousand times lighter, than water, the
  difference in weight of so little Air, as is but equal in bulk to a
  Buble, seem'd to give small hopes, that it would be sensible upon a
  Ballance; yet, by making the Buble very large and light, I supposed and
  found the Event, I have already related.</p>

  <p><i>Secondly</i>, The hermetically seal'd Glass-buble, I employed, was
  of the bigness of a somewhat large <i>Orange</i>, and weigh'd about 1.
  drachme and 10. grains. But I thought it very possible, if I had been
  better furnish'd with conveniencies (wherein I afterwards found, I was
  not mistaken) to make (among many, that might be expected to miscarry)
  some, that might be preferable to this, either for capacity or lightness,
  or both; especially if care be taken, that they be not seal'd up, whilst
  they are too hot. For, though one would think, that it were <!-- Page 235
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page235"></a>{235}</span>advantagious
  to rarify and drive out the Air as much as is possible, because in such
  seal'd Bubles the Air it self (as I have elsewhere shewn) has a weight;
  yet this advantage countervails not the inconvenience of being obliged to
  increase the weight of the Glass, which when it includes highly rarified
  Air, if it be not somewhat strong, will be broken by the pressure of the
  External Air, as I have sufficiently tryed.</p>

  <p><i>Thirdly</i>, I would have tryed, whether the <i>Dryness</i> and
  <i>Moisture</i> of the Air would in any measure have alter'd the weight
  of the Buble, as well as the Variation of Gravity produced in the
  <i>Atmosphere</i> by other causes; but the extraordinarily constant
  absence of Fogs, kept me from making Observations of this kind; save that
  one morning early, being told of a mist, I sent to see (being my self in
  bed) whether it made the Air so heavy as to buoy up the Buble; but did
  not learn, that that mist had any sensible operation on it.</p>

  <p><i>Fourthly</i>, By reason of the difficulties and casualties, that
  may happen about the procuring and preserving such large and light
  Bubles, as I have been lately mentioning; it may in some cases prove a
  convenience to be inform'd, That I have sometimes, instead of one
  sufficiently large Buble, made use of two, that were smaller. And, though
  a single Buble of competent bignes be much preferable, by reason that a
  far less quantity and weight of Glass is requisite to comprise an equal
  capacity, when the Glass is blown into a single Buble, than when it is
  divided into two; yet I found, that the employing of two instead of one,
  did not so ill answer my exspectations, but that they may for a need
  serve the turn instead of the other; than which they are more easier to
  be procured; And if the Ballance be strong enough to bear so much Glass,
  without being injur'd: by employing two or a greater number of large
  Bubles, the effect may be more conspicuous, than if only a single Buble
  (though a very good one) were employed.</p>

  <p>This instrument may be much improved by divers Accommodations, As</p>

  <p><i>First</i>, There may be fitted to the <i>Ansa</i> (or Checks of the
  Ballance) an Arch (of a Circle) divided into 15. or 20. deg. (more or
  less, according to the goodness of the Ballance) that the Cock resting
  over against these Divisions, may readily <!-- Page 236 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page236"></a>{236}</span>and without Calculation
  shew the quantity of the Angle, by which, when the scales propend either
  way, the Cock declines from the Perpendicular, and the beam from its
  Horizontall parallelism.</p>

  <p><i>Secondly</i>, Those, that will be so curious, may, instead of the
  Ordinary Counterpoise (of Brass) employ one of Gold, or at least of Lead,
  whereof the <i>latter</i> being of equal weight with Brass, is much less
  in Bulk, and the <i>former</i> amounts not to half its bigness.</p>

  <p><i>Thirdly</i>, These parts of the Ballance, that may be made of
  Copper or Brass, without any prejudice to the exactness, will, by being
  made of one of those Mettals, be less subject, than Steel, (which yet, if
  well hardned and polish'd, may last good a great while) to rust with long
  standing.</p>

  <p><i>Fourthly</i>, Instead of the scales, the Buble may be hung at one
  end of the Beam, and only a Counterpoise to it at the other, that the
  Beam may not be burthen'd with unnecessary weight.</p>

  <p><i>Fifthly</i>, The whole instrument, if placed in a small Frame, like
  a square Lanthorn with Glass-windows, and a hole at the top for the
  Commerce of the internal and external Air, will be more free from dust,
  and irregular agitations; to the latter of which, it will otherwise be
  sometimes incident.</p>

  <p><i>Sixthly</i>, This instrument being accommodated with a light Wheele
  and an Index (such as have been applyed by the excellent Dr. <i>Chr.
  Wren</i> to open Weather glasses, and by the ingenious Mr. <i>Hook</i> to
  <i>Baroscopes</i>) may be made to shew much more minute variations, than
  otherwise.</p>

  <p><i>Seventhly</i>, And the length of the Beam, and exquisitness of the
  Ballance, may easily, <i>without</i> any of the foregoing helps (and much
  more <i>with</i> them) make the instrument far exacter, than any of
  those, I was reduced to employ. And to these Accommodations divers others
  may be suggested by a farther consideration of the nature of the thing,
  and a longer practice.</p>

  <p>Though in some respects this <i>Statical</i> Baroscope be inferior to
  the <i>Mercurial</i>; yet in others it has its own advantages and
  conveniencies above it.</p>

  <p>And 1: It confirms <i>ad oculum</i> our former Doctrine, that the
  falling and rising of the <i>Mercury</i> depends upon the varying weight
  of the Atmosphere; since in this Baroscope it cannot <!-- Page 237
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page237"></a>{237}</span>be pretended,
  that a <i>Fuga vacui</i>, or a <i>Funiculus</i>, is the cause of the
  changes, we observe. 2. It shews, that not only the Air has weight, but a
  more considerable one, than some Learned men, who will allow me to have
  prov'd, it has some weight, will admit; since even the variation of
  weight in so small a quantity of Air, as is but equal in bulk to an
  <i>Orange</i>, is manifestly discoverable upon such Balances, as are none
  of the nicest. 3. This <i>Statical</i> Baroscope will oftentimes be more
  parable, than the other: For many will finde it more easie, to procure a
  good pair of Gold-scales, and a Buble or two, than a long Cane seal'd, a
  quantity of <i>Quick-silver</i>, and all the other requisits of the
  <i>Mercurial</i> Baroscope; especially if we comprise the trouble and
  skill, that is requisite to free the deserted part of the Tube from Air.
  4. And whereas the difficulty of removing the <i>Mercurial</i> Instrument
  has kept men from so much as attempting to do it, even to neighbouring
  places; the Essential parts of the <i>Scale</i>-Baroscope (for the Frame
  is none of them) may very easily in a little room be carried, whither one
  will, without the hazard of being spoil'd or injur'd. 5. There is not in
  <i>Statical</i> Baroscopes, as in the other, a danger of uncertainty, as
  to the goodness of the Instruments, by reason, that in <i>these</i> the
  Air is, in some more, and in some less perfectly excluded; whereas in
  <i>those</i>, that consideration has no place. (And by the way, I have
  sometimes, upon this account, been able to discover by our new Baroscope,
  that an esteem'd <i>Mercurial</i> one, to which I compared it, was not
  well freed from Air.) 6. It being, as I formerly intimated, very possible
  to discover <i>Hydrostatically</i>, both the bigness of the Buble, and
  the Contents of the cavity, and the weight and dimensions of the Glassie
  substance (which together with the included Air make up the Buble,) much
  may be discover'd by this Instrument, as to the Weight of the Air,
  <i>absolute</i> or <i>respective</i>. For, when the <i>Quick-silver</i>
  in the <i>Mercurial</i> Baroscope is either very high, or very low, or at
  a middle station between its greatest and least height, bringing the
  <i>Scale</i>-Barometer to an exact <i>Æquilibrium</i> (1 with very minute
  divisions of a Graine,) you may, by watchfully observing, when the
  <i>Mercury</i> is risen or faln just an inch, or a fourth, of half an
  inch &amp;c. and putting in the like minute divisions of a Grain to the
  lighter Scale, till you have again brought the Ballance to an <!-- Page
  238 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page238"></a>{238}</span>exquisit
  <i>Æquilibrium</i>; you may, I say, determine, What known weight in the
  <i>Statical</i> Baroscope answers such determinate Altitudes of the
  ascending and descending Quick-silver in the <i>Mercurial</i>. And if the
  Ballance be accommodated with a divided Arch, or a Wheel and Index, these
  Observations will assist you for the future to determine readily, by
  seeing the inclination of the Cock or the degree mark'd by the Index,
  what pollency the Buble hath, by the change of the <i>Atmospheres</i>
  weight, acquired or lost. Some Observations of this nature I watchfully
  made, sometimes putting in a 64<sup>th.</sup> sometimes a
  32<sup>th.</sup> sometimes a 16<sup>th.</sup> and sometimes heavier parts
  of a Grain, to the lighter Scale. But one, that knew not, for what uses
  those little papers were, coming to a window, where my Baroscopes stood,
  so unluckily shook them out of the Scales, and confounded them, that he
  robb'd me of the opportunity of making the nice Observations I intended,
  though I had the satisfaction of seeing, that they were to be made. 7. By
  this <i>Statical</i> Instrument we may be assisted to compare the
  <i>Mercurial</i> Baroscopes of <i>several</i> places (though never so
  distant) and to make some Estimates of the Gravities of the Air therein.
  As if, for instance, I have found by Observation, that the Buble, I
  employ, (and one may have divers Bubles of several sizes, that the one
  may repaire any mischance, that may happen to another) weigh'd just a
  Drachme, when the <i>Mercurial</i> Cylinder was at the height of 29½
  inches (which in some places I have found a <i>moderate</i> altitude;)
  and that the Addition of the 16th part of a gr. is requisite to keep the
  Buble in an <i>Æquilibrium</i>, when the <i>Mercury</i> is risen an 8th,
  or any determinate part of an inch above the former station: When I come
  to another place, where there is a <i>Mercurial</i> Barometer, as well
  freed from Air as mine (for that must be supposed) if taking out my
  <i>Scale</i> instrument, it appeare to weigh precisely a Drachme, and the
  <i>Mercury</i> in the Baroscope there stand at just 29½ inches, we may
  conclude the Gravity of the Atmosphere not to be sensibly unequal in both
  those two places, though very distant. And though there be no Baroscope
  there, yet if there be an additional weight, as for instance, the 16th
  part of a Grain requisite to be added to the Buble, to bring the scales
  to an <i>Æquilibrium</i>, it will appear that the Air at this second
  place is, at that time <!-- Page 239 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page239"></a>{239}</span>so much heavier, than the Air of the
  former place was, when the <i>Mercury</i> stood at 29½ inches.</p>

  <p>But in making such comparisons, we must not forget to consider the
  Situation of the several places, if we mean to make Estimates not only of
  the weight of the Atmosphere, but of the weight and density of the Air.
  For, though the Scales wil shew (as has been said) whether there be a
  difference of weight in the Atmosphere at the two places; yet, if one of
  them be in a Vale or bottom, and the other on the top or some elevated
  part of a Hill, it is not to be exspected, that the Atmosphere, in this
  latter place, should gravitate as much, as the Atmosphere in the former,
  on which a longer Pillar of Air does lean or weigh.</p>

  <p>And the mention, I have made of the differing Situation of Places,
  puts me in mind of something, that may prove another use of our
  <i>Statical</i> Baroscope, and which I had thoughts of making tryal off,
  but was Accidentally hindred from the opportunity of doing it. Namely,
  that by exactly poysing the Buble at the foot of a high Steeple or Hill,
  and carrying it in its close Frame to the top, one may, by the weight
  requisite to be added to Counterpoise there to bring the Beam to its
  Horizontal position, observe the difference of the weight of the Air at
  the bottom, and at the top; and, in case the Hill be high enough, at some
  intermediate Stations. But how far this may assist men, to estimate the
  <i>Absolute</i> or <i>Comparative</i> height of Mountains, and other
  elevated Places; and what other Uses the Instrument may be put to, when
  it is duly improved; and the Cautions, that may be requisite in the
  several cases, that shall be proposed, I must leave to more leasure, and

<h3><i>The Particulars of those Observations of the Planet </i>Mars<i>, formerly intimated
to have been made at </i>London<i> in the Months of </i>February<i> and </i>March<i> A.</i> 166<sup>5</sup>/<sub>6</sub>.</h3>

  <p>To perform, what was promised <i>Num.</i> 11. of these Papers,
  <i>pag.</i> <a href="#page198">198</a>; 'tis thought fit now to publish
  the Particular Observations, concerning the spots in <i>Mars</i>, and
  their motion, as they were made with a 36 foot Telescope, and produced in
  <!-- Page 240 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page240"></a>{240}</span>writing before the <i>Royal Society</i>,
  the 28 <i>March</i> 1666. by Mr. <i>Hook</i>, as follows;</p>

  <p>Having a great desire (saith he) to observe the Body of <i>Mars</i>,
  whilst <i>Acronycal</i> and <i>Retrograde</i> (having formerly with a
  Glass of about 12. foot long, observ'd some kind of Spots in the Face of
  it,) though it be not at present in the <i>Perihelium</i> of its Orbe,
  but nearer its <i>Aphelium</i>, yet I found, that the Face of it, when
  neer its Opposition to the Sun (with a Charge, the 36. foot-glass, I made
  use off, would well bear) appear'd very near as big, as that of the Moon
  to the <i>naked</i> eye; which I found, by comparing it with the Full
  Moon, near adjoyning to it, <i>March</i> 10.</p>

  <p>But such had been the ill disposition of the Air for several nights,
  that from more than 20. Observations of it, which I had made since its
  being <i>Retrograde</i>, I could find nothing of satisfaction, though I
  often imagin'd, I saw Spots, yet the <i>Inflective veins</i> of the Air
  (if I may so call those parts, which, being interspers'd up and down in
  it, have a greater or less Refractive power, than the Air next adjoyning,
  with which they are mixt) did make it so confus'd and glaring, that I
  could not conclude upon any thing.</p>

  <p>On the third of <i>March</i>, though the Air were still bad enough yet
  I could see now and then the Body of <i>Mars</i> appearing of the form A:
  which I presently described by a <i>Scheme</i>; and about 10. minutes
  after, as exactly representing what I saw through the Glass, as I could,
  I drew the <i>Scheme</i> B. This I was sufficiently satisfied (by very
  often observing it through the Tube, and changing my Eye into various
  positions, that so there might be no kind of Fallacy in it) could be
  nothing else, but some more <i>Dusky</i> and <i>Spotted</i> parts of the
  Face of this Planet.</p>

  <p><i>March</i> 10. finding the Air very bad, I made use of a very
  shallow Eye-glass, as finding nothing <i>Distinct</i> with the greater
  <i>Charge</i>; and saw the appearance of it as in C, which I imagin'd,
  might be the Representation of the former Spots by a lesser charge. About
  3 of the Clock the same morning, the Air being <i>very bad</i> (though to
  appearance <i>exceeding clear</i>, and causing all the Stars to twinckle,
  and the minute Stars to appear very thick) the body seem'd like <i>D</i>;
  which I still suppos'd to be <!-- Page 241 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page241"></a>{241}</span>the Representation of the same Spots
  through a more confused and glaring Air.</p>

  <p>But observing <i>March</i> 21. I was surprised to find the Air (though
  not so clear, as to the appearance of small Stars) so <i>exceeding
  transparent</i>, and the Face of <i>Mars</i> so very well <i>defined</i>,
  and round, and distinct, that I could manifestly see it of the shape in
  E. about half an hour after Nine at night. The <i>Triangular</i> spot on
  the right side (as it was inverted by the Telescope, according to the
  appearances, through with all the preceeding <i>Figures</i> are drawn)
  appear'd very black and distinct, the other towards the left more dim;
  but both of them sufficiently plain and defin'd. About a quarter before
  12. of the Clock the same night, I observ'd it again with the same Glass,
  and found the appearance exactly, as in F; which I imagin'd to shew me a
  <i>Motion</i> of the former triangular spot: But designing to observe it
  again about 3. of the Clock the same Morning, I was hindred by cloudy
  weather.</p>

  <p>But <i>March</i> 22. about half an hour after 8. at night, finding the
  same Spots in the same posture, I concluded, that the preceeding
  Observation was only the appearance of the same Spots at another height
  and thickness of the Air: And thought my self confirm'd in this Opinion,
  by finding them in much the same posture, <i>March</i> 23. about half an
  hour after 9. though the Air was nothing so good as before.</p>

  <p>And though I desired to make Observations, about 3. of the Clock those
  mornings; yet something or other interven'd, that hindred me, till
  <i>March</i> 28. about 3 of the Clock, the Air being light (in weight)
  though moist and a little hazy; when I plainly saw it, to have the form,
  represented in I; which is not reconcileable with the other Appearances,
  unless we allow a <i>Turbinated</i> motion of <i>Mars</i> upon its
  Center: Which, if such there be, from the Observations made <i>March</i>
  21. 22. and 23. we may guess it to be once or twice in about 24. hours
  unless it may have some kind of <i>Librating</i> motion; which seems not
  so likely. Now, whether certainly so or not, I shall endeavour, as oft as
  I have opportunity, further to observe.</p>

<h3><i>Observations
made in </i>Italy<i>, confirming the former, and withall fixing the
</i>Period<i> of the Revolution of </i>Mars<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>These Observations we shall summarily present the Curious in these
  parts with, as they were lately presented (by Letter from his Excellency
  the Ambassadour of <i>Venice</i>, now residing at the Court of
  <i>France</i>) to the <i>Royal Society</i>, in some printed sheets of
  Paper, entituled, <i>MARTIS, circa Axem proprium Revolubilis,
  Observationes, BONONIÆ à JO. DOMINICO CASSINO habitæ;</i> come to hand
  <i>June</i> 3. 1666.</p>

<p class="cenhead">In these Papers the Excellent <i>Cassini</i> affirms;</p>

  <p>1. That with a <i>Telescope</i> of 24. <i>Palmes</i>, or of about 16
  <i>Foot</i>, wrought after S. <i>Campani's</i> way, he began to observe
  <i>February</i> 6. 1666 (st.n.) in the morning, and saw two dark Spots in
  the <i>first</i> Face of <i>Mars.</i> <!-- Page 243 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page243"></a>{243}</span></p>

  <p>2. That with the same Glass he observ'd <i>Febr.</i>
  <sup>14</sup>/<sub>24</sub>. in the Evening, in the <i>other</i> Face of
  this Planet, two other Spots, like those of the first, but bigger.</p>

  <p>3. That afterwards continuing the Observations, he found the Spots of
  these two Faces to turn by little and little from <i>East</i> to
  <i>West</i>, and to return at last to the same situation, wherein he had
  seen them first.</p>

  <p>4. That S. <i>Campani</i>, having also observ'd at <i>Rome</i> with
  Glasses of 50. <i>Palmes</i> or about 35 <i>Foot</i>, likewise of his own
  contrivance, had seen in the same Planet the same <i>Phenomena</i>.</p>

  <p><span class="correction" title="Original reads `4.'.">5.</span> That
  sometimes he hath seen, during the same night, the two Faces of
  <i>Mars</i>, one, in the Evening, the other in the Morning.</p>

  <p>6. That the Motion of these Spots in the inferior part of the apparent
  Hemisphere of <i>Mars</i>, is made from <i>East</i> to <i>West</i>, as
  that of all the other Celestial Bodies, and is peform'd by Parallels,
  that decline <i>much</i> from the <i>Equator</i>, and <i>little</i> from
  the <i>Ecliptick</i>.</p>

  <p>7. That the Spots return the next day to the same situation, 40.
  minuts later, than the day before; so that in every 36. or 37. daies,
  about the same hour, they come again to the same place.</p>

  <p>8. He promises shortly to give us the particular <i>Tables</i> of this
  Motion and of its Inequalities, together with the <i>Ephemerides</i>
  themselves.</p>

  <p>9. He represents, that some other <i>Astronomers</i> have also made at
  <i>Rome</i> several Observations of these Spots of <i>Mars</i>, from
  <i>March <sup>14</sup>/<sub>24</sub>.</i> to <i>March
  <sup>20</sup>/<sub>30</sub>.</i> with Glasses, wrought by <i>Eustachio
  Divini</i>, of 25. and 45. Palmes; Which Spots he makes little differing
  from his own, of the first Face; as will by and by appear, by the
  direction to the <i>Schemes</i>.</p>

  <p>10. But he adds, that those other <i>Roman</i> Astronomers, that have
  observ'd with <i>Divini's</i> Glasses, will have the Conversion of
  <i>Mars</i> to be performed, not in 24 h, 40 m. (as he maintains it is)
  but in about 13 h.</p>

  <p>11. And to evince, that they are mistaken in these Observations of
  theirs; he alledges, That they assure that the Spots, which they have
  seen in this Planet, (by an <i>Eustachian</i> Telescope) the
  <sup>20</sup>/<sub>30</sub> of <i>March</i>, were small, very distant
  from one <span class="correction" title="Original reads `anothe'."
  >another,</span> remote from the middle of the Disk, and the
  <i>Oriental</i> Spot was less, than the <i>Occidental</i> (as is
  represented by the Fig. O; like that of the first Face of <i>Mars</i>.)
  whereas, on the contrary, <!-- Page 244 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page244"></a>{244}</span>He (<i>Cassini</i>) pretends to evidence
  by his Observations, made at the same time at <i>Bononia</i>, that, the
  same day and hour, those Spots were very large, neer one another, in the
  midst of the Disk, the Oriental bigger than the Occidental (as appears by
  <i>Fig.</i> P, which is that of the second Face of <i>Mars</i>.)</p>

  <p>12. Besides, he declares, that those <i>Astronomers</i> were too
  hasty, in determining, after 5 or 6 Observations only, in how much time
  <i>Mars</i> finish's his Revolution; and denies it to be perform'd in 13
  hours: adding, that, though Himself had observ'd for a much longer time,
  than they; yet he durst not for a great while define, Whether <i>Mars</i>
  made but <i>one</i> Turn in 24 hours 40 minuts or <i>two</i>; and that
  all, that he could, for a long time affirm, was onely this, that after 24
  h. 40 m. this Planet appear'd in the same manner he did before.</p>

  <p>13. But since those first Observations, He affirms to have found cause
  to determine, that the Period of this Conversion is made in the said
  space of 24 h. 40 m; and not oftner than once within that time; Alledging
  for proof;</p>

  <p>1. That, whereas <i>Febr.</i> 6. (st.n.) he saw the Spots of the first
  Face of <i>Mars</i>, moving from eleven of the Clock in the night, until
  break of day, they appear'd not afterwards in the Evening after the
  rising of that Planet (witness several intelligent persons, which he
  names, that were present at the Observations) Whence he infers, that
  after 12 hours and 20 minuts, the same Spots did not come about; since
  that the same, which in the morning were seen in the middle, upon the
  rising of <i>Mars</i>; after 13 or 14 hours, might have appear'd neer the
  Occidental Limb. But, because he might be imposed upon by Vapors, whilst
  <i>Mars</i> was yet so neer the <i>Horizon</i>, he gives this other
  determination, <i>vid.</i></p>

  <p>2. Whereas he saw the first Face of <i>Mars</i> the 6 of
  <i>February</i> at 11 of the clock of the night following; he did not see
  the same after 18 daies at the same hour; as he ought to have done, if
  the Period were absolved in the space of 12 h. 20 m.</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:27%;">
      <a href="images/VI_N14_Sch2.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/VI_N14_Sch2.png"
      alt="Sch. II." title="Sch. II." /></a>
  </div>
  <p>3. Again, whereas he saw <i>Febr.</i> 24. in the Evening, the other
  Face of <i>Mars</i>, he could not see the same, the 13. and 15. day of
  <i>March</i>, to wit after 17 and 19 days; as he should have done, if the
  Revolution were made in the newly mention'd time.</p>

  <p>4. Again, whereas the 27. of <i>March</i> in the Evening he saw <!--
  Page 245 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page245"></a>{245}</span>the
  second Face of <i>Mars</i>, he could not see it the 14. and 16. of
  <i>April</i>.</p>

  <p>From all which Observations he Judges it to be evident, that the
  Period of this Planets Revolution is not perform'd in the space of 12.
  hours 20, minutes, but in about 24 hours 40 minutes; more exactly to be
  determin'd by comparing distant Observations: And that those who affirm
  the former, must have been deceived by not well distinguishing the two
  Faces, but that having seen the second, taken it for the first.</p>

  <p>All which he concludes with this Advertisement, that, when he defines
  the time of the Revolution of <i>Mars</i>, he does not speak of its
  <i>Mean</i> Revolution, but onely of that, which he observ'd, whilst
  <i>Mars</i> was opposite to the Sun; which is the shortest of all.</p>

<h3><i>Some Observations
lately made at </i>London<i> concerning the
Planet </i>Jupiter<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>These, as they were made, so they were imparted, by Mr. <i>Hook</i>,
  as follows:</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:23%;">
      <a href="images/VI_N14_Sch3.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/VI_N14_Sch3.png"
      alt="Sch. III." title="Sch. III." /></a>
  </div>
  <p>A. 1666, <i>June</i> 26. between 3. and 4. of the Clock in the
  morning, I observed the Body of <i>Jupiter</i> through a 60 foot-glass,
  and found the apparent Diameter of it through the Tube, to be somewhat
  more than 2. degrees, that is, about four <!-- Page 246 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page246"></a>{246}</span>times as big, as the
  Diameter of the <i>Moon</i> appears to the <i>naked</i> Eye. I saw the
  Limb pretty round, and very well defin'd without radiation. The parts of
  the <i>Phasis</i> of it had various degrees of Light. About <i>a</i> and
  <i>f</i>, the <i>North</i> and <i>South</i> poles of it (in the <i>Fig
  Q.</i>) 'twas somewhat darker, and by degrees it grew brighter towards
  <i>b</i>. and <i>e</i>, two Belts or Zones; the one of which (<i>b</i>)
  was a small dark <i>Belt</i> crossing the Body Southward; Adjoyning to
  which was a smal Line of a somewhat lighter part; and below that again,
  Southwards, was the great black <i>Belt c</i>. Between that, and
  <i>e</i>, the other smaller black Belt, was a pretty large and bright
  <i>Zone</i>; but the middle <i>d</i>, was somewhat darker than the edges.
  I perceiv'd about 3<sup>h.</sup> 15<sup>m.</sup> near the middle of this,
  a very <i>dark round Spot</i>, like that represented at <i>g</i>, which
  was not to be perceiv'd about half an hour before: And I observed it, in
  about 10. minutes time to be gotten almost to <i>d</i>, keeping equal
  distance from the <i>Satelles h</i>, which moved also Westwardly, and was
  joyn'd to the Disk at <i>i</i>, at 3<sup>h.</sup> 25<sup>m.</sup> After
  which, the Air growing very hazy, and (as appeared by the
  <i>Baroscope</i>) very light also (in weight) I could not observe it: So
  that it was sufficiently evident, that this black Spot was nothing else,
  save the shadow of the <i>Satelles h</i>, Eclipsing a part of the Face of
  Jupiter. About two hours before, I had observed a large darker spot in
  the bigger <i>Belt</i> about <i>k</i>, which in about an hour or little
  more (for I did not exactly observe the time, nor draw the <i>Figure</i>
  of it) moving Westwards, disappear'd. About a week before, I discover'd
  also, together with a Spot in the <i>Belt c</i>, another Spot in the
  <i>Belt e</i>, which kept the same way and velocity with that of the
  <i>Belt c</i>. The other three <i>Satellites</i> in the time of this
  Eclipse, made by the <i>Satelles</i>, were Westwards of the Body of
  <i>Jupiter</i>; appearing as bright through the Tube, as the Body of
  <i>Jupiter</i> did to the naked Eye, and I was able to see them longer
  through the Tube, after the day-light came on, than I was able to see the
  Body of <i>Jupiter</i> with my naked eye.</p>

  <p><i>June</i> 29 1666. between 11. and 12. at night I observed the Body
  of <i>Saturn</i> through a 60. foot Telescope, and found it <!-- Page 247
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page247"></a>{247}</span>exactly of the
  shape represented in the <i>Figure</i> R. The <i>Ring</i> appear'd of a
  somewhat brighter Light than the <i>Body</i>; and the black lines <i>a
  a</i>, crossing the Ring, and <i>b b</i> crossing the Body (whether
  Shadows or not, I dispute not) were plainly visible: whence I could
  manifestly see, that the <i>Souther</i>-most part of the Ring was on
  <i>this</i> side of the Body, and the <i>Northern</i> part, behind, or
  covered by the Body.</p>

<h3><i>A Relation
of a sad effect of Thunder and Lightning:</i></h3>

  <p>This Relation was written by that worthy Gentleman, <i>Thomas
  Neale</i> Esquire, (the then <i>High Sheriff</i> of the County of
  <i>Hampshire</i>, when this disaster hapned) to a Friend of his in
  <i>London</i>, as follows;</p>

  <p>On the 24 of <i>January</i> 166<sup>5</sup>/<sub>6</sub>, one Mr.
  <i>Brooks</i> of <i>Hampshire</i>, going from <i>Winchester</i> towards
  his house near <i>Andover</i> in very bad Weather, was himself slain by
  Lightning, and the Horse, he rode on, under him. For about a mile from
  <i>Winchester</i> he was found with his Face beaten into the ground, one
  leg in the stirrup, the other in the Horses mane; his Cloaths all burnt
  off his back, not a piece as big as a handkerchief left intire, and his
  hair and all his body singed. With the force, that struck him down, his
  nose was beaten into his face, and his Chin into his Breast; where was a
  wound cut almost as low, as to his Navil; and his cloaths being, as
  aforesaid, torn, the pieces were so scatter'd and consum'd, that not
  enough to fill the crown of a hat could be found. His gloves were whole,
  but his hands in them sing'd to the bone. The hip-bone and shoulder of
  his Horse burn't and bruised; and his saddle torn in little pieces. This
  was what appear'd to the Coroners inquest, and so is likely to be as near
  truth, as any is to be had.</p>

  <p><i>So far this Letter</i>: Which, if it had come soon enough to the
  hands of the <i>Publisher</i>, would have been joyned to a like
  <i>Relation</i>, inserted in the next foregoing Papers (<i>Num.</i> 13.)
  of an accident hapn'd at a later time. With both which may be compared
  the Account, formerly published in Latin by the Learned Dr.
  <i>Charleton</i>, concerning the Boy, that was <!-- Page 248 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page248"></a>{248}</span>Thunder-struck near
  <i>Nantwich in Cheshire;</i> the Title of the Book being <i>Anatome
  Pueride Cælo tacti</i>: such Relations, when truly made, well deserving
  to be carefully recorded for farther consideration.</p>

<h3><i>Of some Books lately publish't.</i></h3>

  <p><i>RELATIONS OF DIVERS CURIOUS VOYAGES</i>, by <i>Mons. Thevenot</i>,
  the third <i>Tome</i>, in <i>French</i>. This Book contains chiefly, the
  Ambassie of the <i>Dutch</i> into <i>China</i>, translated out of the
  Dutch manuscript: A Geographical description of <i>China</i>, translated
  out of a Chinese Author by <i>Martinius</i>: And the Account, which the
  Directors of the Dutch East-India Company made to the States General,
  touching the state of affairs in the East-Indies, when their late Fleet
  parted from thence. To touch some things of a <i>Geographical</i> and
  <i>Philosophical</i> nature, contained therein, we shall take notice;</p>

  <p>1. How the Kingdom of <i>China</i> is peopled; there being according
  to the best computation (which is there made with singular care) above 58
  millions of Men, not counting Magistrates, Soldiers, Priests, Eunuchs,
  Women and Children; so that it may not be altogether strange, if one
  should affirm, there were 200 millions of people, of all sorts, in that
  Kingdom.</p>

  <p>2. That <i>Catay</i> is nothing else, but the <i>Six</i> Northern
  Provinces of <i>China</i>, separated from the other <i>Nine</i>, by the
  great River <i>KIANG</i>; and that the City <i>Cambalu</i> is the same
  with that of <i>Peking</i>; the <i>Tartars</i>, who carry every three
  years their Tribute to the Emperor of <i>China</i>, constantly calling
  the said Provinces and City by those names of <i>Catay</i>, and
  <i>Cambalu</i>.</p>

  <p>3. That <i>China</i> is so well furnisht with Rivers, and cut
  Channels, that men may go from the most Southern to the most Northern
  part thereof by water, except one daies journey; as the Dutch
  Ambassadours did, embarking at <i>Canton</i>, which is 23d. 48m. Northern
  Latitude, and landing at <i>Peking</i>, which is about 40d; having only
  travell'd one daies journey over some Mountains of the Province
  <i>Kiamsi</i>.</p>

  <p>4. That the people of <i>China</i> are exceeding industrious <!-- Page
  249 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page249"></a>{249}</span>Husbandmen
  making, among other waies of improving their soile, great use of
  Flouding.</p>

  <p>5. That the <i>Physicians</i> of <i>China</i> do cure Sicknesses with
  much ease, and in a short time: That they have very ancient Books of the
  nature and vertues of Herbs, Trees and Stones: That their Modern
  Physicians (as well as their Ancient ones did) write of the Prognosticks,
  Causes, Effects, &amp;c. of Diseases. That their Remedies consist for the
  most part of <i>Simples</i> and <i>Decoctions</i>, <i>Cauteries</i>,
  <i>Frictions</i>; without the use of <i>Bloud letting:</i> That they have
  such an excellent skill and method in feeling the <i>Pulse</i>, that by
  the means thereof they discover even the most latent causes of Diseases;
  taking a good half hour, when they visit a Patient, in feeling and
  examining his Pulse: That they prescribe much the use of <i>The</i>; and
  the drinking alwayes warme, whatever they drink: To the custome of both
  which it's imputed, that the inhabitants of <i>China</i> do spit very
  little, nor are subject to the Stone or Gout: That they prise highly the
  Root <i>Ginseng</i>, as an extraordinary Restorative and Cordiall,
  recovering frequently with it agonizing persons; one pound of it being
  paid with 3 pounds of silver. As for their <i>Chymists</i>, (of which
  they have also good store) they go beyond ours, promising not only to
  make Gold, but to give Immortality.</p>

  <p>6. That their <i>Nobility</i> is raised from Learning and Knowledge,
  without regard to Bloud or Parentage, excepting the Royall Family.</p>

  <p>7. That in <i>CHEKIAN</i>, a maritime Province, whence is the shortest
  cut of <i>China</i> to <i>Japan</i>, is the best and plentifullest
  <i>Silk-trade</i> in the world: And that there every year the Mulberries
  are cutt, and kept down, that they grow not into Trees for the easier
  gathering of the Leaves, there being a <i>double</i> Silk-harvest in that
  Country, as there is in severall other parts of the East-indies; (both
  which there is hope, will shortly be imitated in <i>Virginia</i>.)</p>

  <p>8. That the way of making <i>Porcelane</i> is this: (<i>Which is the
  rather inserted here, because it agrees so well with an Account, we
  received a while since from a very Curious and intelligent Person of
  Amsterdam.</i>) There is in the Province of <i>Nankin</i> a Town, call'd
  <!-- Page 250 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page250"></a>{250}</span><i>Goesifols</i> whence they draw the
  Earth for <i>Porcelaine</i>, which is found between the Rocks of
  Mountains. This Earth they beat very small, and stamp it to a very fine
  Powder, and then put it into Tubs fill'd with water; where the finest
  part sinks to the bottom. Afterwards 'tis kneaded in the form of small
  Cubes, of the weight of about 3. <i>Catti</i> (a <i>Catti</i> being 20
  Ounces.) These pieces thus wrought are sold to the people, that commonly
  in great numbers fetch them, coming from the Town <i>Sintesimo</i>
  (otherwise <i>Jontiou</i>) in the Province of <i>Kiansy</i>, being about
  50 miles distant from <i>Wotsing</i>, neer the City <i>KIANSY</i>; which
  people transport them to their homes, and there bake them in this manner:
  They heat their Ovens well, for the space of 15 daies successively, and
  then keep them so close, that no Air may get in; and after 15
  <i>other</i> daies are pass'd, they open the Oven in the presence of an
  Officer, who takes every fifth vessel of each fashion for the service of
  the Emperor: Which done, the rest is sold to those of <i>Ucienien</i>,
  whence it is transported all over the Country. So that the Earth is not
  prepared, in <i>Nankin</i>, where 'tis found, because the people of that
  Province have not the skill of working it, as the other above-mention'd;
  who also alone have the Art of coloring it, which they keep as a great
  Secret, not teaching it to any, but their Children and next Kindred.</p>

  <p>9. That <i>Musk</i> is nothing else, but the Testicles of a Beast like
  a Dear, found in the Province of <i>Honan</i>; and that, when tis good
  and unmixt, as it comes from the Animal, they sell it even in
  <i>Nankin</i> and <i>Pekin</i>, for 30. or 35. <i>Teyls</i> (that is,
  about so many Crowns) the <i>Catti</i>.</p>

  <p>Many other curious informations might be borrow'd from this Author,
  concerning the Customs, Studies, Exercises of the <i>Chinese</i>; of the
  number of the people of each Province; of the Natural productions of the
  Earth and Rivers there; of the Structure and Antiquity of their Wall; of
  the Magnificence of their Porcelain Tower &amp;c.; but, remitting for
  these things to the Book it self, we shal only add a piece of Oeconomy,
  used by the <i>Holland</i>-Merchants in their Commerce with <i>China</i>,
  which is, that they dry abundance of Sage-leaves, role them up, and <!--
  Page 251 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page251"></a>{251}</span>prepare them like <i>The</i>, and carrying
  it to <i>China</i>, as a rare drogue, get for one pound of it, fourtimes
  as much <i>The</i>.</p>

  <p><i>A DISCOURSE ABOUT THE CAUSES OF THE INUNDATION OF THE NILE</i>, in
  <i>French</i>. The Author of this Book is Monseiur <i>dela Chambre</i>,
  who being perswaded from several Circumstances, that accompany the
  Overflowing of this River, that it cannot proceed from Rain, ventures to
  assign for a Cause of <i>it</i>, and of all the other effects that happen
  at the time of its swelling, the <i>Niter</i>, wherewith that water
  abounds.</p>

  <p>The discourse having six parts, the Author endeavours to shew in
  the</p>

  <p><i>First</i>, that the Waters of the <i>Nile</i> are Nitrous,
  explicating the Nature of Salt, and Saltpeter, and imputing the fertility
  of the Earth, as well us the fecundity of Animals, to Salt. Where he
  shews, that all things, that serve to improve Land, are full of Salt; and
  that 'tis observ'd, that grain steep'd in Vrine, before sowing, rises
  sooner, and becomes fuller and stronger, than else. Adding, that that,
  which renders the Seed of Animals prolifick, is, that one of the
  <i>Spermatick</i> veins hath its Origine from the <i>Emulgent</i>,
  through which the Nitrous and Saline Serosities, that discharge
  themselves into the Kidneys and Bladder, do pass.</p>

  <p>In the <i>Second</i>, he examins, what is Fermentation, and how 'tis
  perform'd; affirming, that, what thrusts forth Plants in the Spring, is,
  that the Earth being fermented by the <i>Niter</i>, it harbours, the
  Nitrous spirits insinuate themselves into their Pores.</p>

  <p>In the <i>Third</i> he treats of all the Circumstances, observable in
  the Inundation of the Nile. 'Tis affirm'd, that 3 or 4 days before that
  River begins to overflow, all its water is troubled: that then there
  falls a certain Dew, which hath a fermenting vertue, and leavens a Paste
  exposed to the Air: that the Mud, which has been drawn out of the water,
  grows heavier, when the overflowing begins, then it was before, and that
  by the increase of the weight of that Mud, they judge of the greatness of
  the approaching inundation. The Author pretends, that <!-- Page 252
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page252"></a>{252}</span>the Niter,
  which the <i>Nile</i> is stored with, is the cause of all these strange
  effects, and of many others, by him alledged. For, <i>saith he</i>, when
  the Nitre is heated by the heat of the Sun, it ferments, and mingling
  with the water, troubles it, and swells it, and makes it pass beyond its
  banks; after the same manner, as the Spirits in new Wine render it
  troubled, and make it boyle in the vessel. And it seems not likely to
  him, that the Mud, found in the <i>Nile</i>, should come a far off; for
  then it would at last so raise the banks of this River, that it would not
  be able to overflow them any longer. Whereas 'tis more than 2000 years,
  that the banks thereof are not grown higher, there being now requisite
  but 16. cubits for overflowing the Land, no more than there was in the
  time of <i>Herodotus</i>. Which shews, <i>saith he</i>, that this Mud is
  nothing but a volatil <i>Niter</i>, which exhaling, doth not increase the
  Earth. As for the <i>Ægyptian</i> Dew, and the increase of the weight of
  the Mud, he adscribes them to the same Cause. For the spirits of Nitre
  abounding in the <i>Nile</i>, when raised into the Air with the vapors,
  that exhale continually from this River, there is made out of their
  mixture, a Dew, that refreshes the Air, makes sickness to cease, and
  produces all those admirable effects, that make the <i>Ægyptians</i> wish
  for it so passionately. And the same spirits of Niter, being joyned to
  the Paste, and to the Mud, raise the one, and augment the weight of the
  other. That, which Mr. <i>Buratini</i> observes, that at the time of this
  inundation, the Niter-pits of the neighboring places vomit out liquid
  Niter, and that one may see issue out of the Earth abundance of Chrystals
  of Nitre, is alledged to fortify this conjecture; Which is yet more
  confirm'd by the Fertility, communicated to the Earth by the Mud of this
  River. For, plants do grow there in such abundance, that they would choak
  one another, if it were not remedied by throwing Sand upon the Fields;
  insomuch that the <i>Ægyptians</i> must take as much pains to spread Sand
  to lessen the fatness of their Land, as other Nations do, to spread dung
  or other manure upon theirs to increase the fatness.</p>

  <p>In the <i>Fourth</i> and <i>Fifth</i>, the Author undertakes to prove,
  that all those strange effects cannot be attributed to Rain or Snow, <!--
  Page 253 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page253"></a>{253}</span>and
  that the overflowing of the <i>Nile</i> always happens at a certain
  day.</p>

  <p>In the <i>Last</i>, he alledges some Relations, serving to confirm his
  Opinion; Which are too long here to insist upon.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p><i>DE PRINCIPIIS ET RATIOCINATIONE GEOMETRARUM, Contra Fastum
  Professorum Geometriæ;</i> Authore <i>Thoma Hobbes</i>. It seems, that
  this Author is angry with all Geometricians, but himself; yea he plainly
  saith in the dedication of his Book, that <i>he invades the whole Nation
  of them</i>; and unwilling, it seems, to be call'd to an account for
  doing so; He will acknowledge no judge of <i>this</i> Age; but is full of
  hopes, that posterity will pronounce for him. Mean while he ventures to
  advance this <i>Dilemma</i>; <i>Eorum qui de iisdem rebus mecum aliquid
  ediderunt, aut solus insanio Ego, aut solus non insanio; tertium enim non
  est, nisi (quod dicet forte aliquis) insaniamus omnes.</i> Doubtless, one
  of these will be granted him.</p>

  <p>As to the Book it self, he professes, that he doth not write it
  against <i>Geometry</i>, but <i>Geometers</i>; and that his design in it
  is, to shew, That there is no less uncertainty and falsity in the
  writings of <i>Mathematicians</i>, than there is in those of
  <i>Naturalists</i>, <i>Moralists</i>, &amp;c., though he judges, that
  <i>Physicks</i>, <i>Ethicks</i>, <i>Politicks</i>, if they were well
  demonstrated, would be as certain as the <i>Mathematicks</i>.</p>

  <p>Attacking the Mathematical Principles as they are found in Books, and
  withall some Demonstrations, he takes to task <i>Euclid</i> himself,
  instead of all, as the Master of all Geometricians, and with him his best
  interpreter, <i>Clavius</i>, examining in the <i>First</i> place, the
  <i>Principles</i> of <i>Euclid</i>: <i>Secondly</i>, Declaring false,
  what is superstructed upon them, whether by <i>Euclid</i>, or
  <i>Clavius</i>, or any <i>Geometer</i> whatsoever that hath made use of
  those or other (as he is pleased to entitle them) <i>false</i>
  Principles. <i>Thirdly</i>, Pretending, that he means so to combat all,
  both Principles and Demonstrations, undertaken by him, as that he will
  substitute better in their room, least he should seem to undermine the
  Science it selfe. <!-- Page 254 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <p><i>KING SALOMONS POUTRAITURE OF OLD AGE</i>; by <i>John Smith</i>,
  M.D. This Treatise being a <i>Philosophical</i> Discourse, though upon a
  <i>Sacred</i> Theme, may certainly claim a place among
  <i>Philosophical</i> Transactions. Not here to mention the many other
  learned Notes, this Worthy Author gives upon that Hieroglyphical
  Description of Old Age, made by that Royal Pen-man of
  <i>Ecclesiastes</i>, cap. 12. We shall onely take notice of that
  surprizingly Ingenious one, there to be met with, concerning the
  Antiquity of the Doctrine of the <i>Blood's Circulation</i>: King
  <i>Salomon</i>, who lived neer 2700 years agoe, using such expressions,
  as may, to a considering Reader, very probably denote the same Doctrine,
  which the Sagacious Dr. <i>Harvey</i> has of late years so happily
  brought to light, and introduced into all the most Ingenuous Societies of
  Learned men: The <i>Pitcher</i>, mention'd in the quoted place, being
  Interpreted for the <i>Veines</i>, and the <i>Fountain</i> for the
  <i>Right Ventricle of the Heart</i>, as the <i>Cistern</i> for the
  <i>Left</i>; the <i>Wheele</i>, there spoken off, manifestly importing a
  <i>Circulation</i>, made by the <i>Great Artery</i> with its Branches,
  the principal Instrument thereof.</p>

  <p>This subject will it self, 'tis presumed, without any other
  <i>Preamble</i>, speak the Cause, why this present Paper is publish't at
  this (unusual) time of the Month: though, by the by, it may not be amiss
  to add on this occasion, that the Publisher of these <i>Tracts</i> never
  meant so to confine himself to a <i>Set</i> time, as not to retain the
  Liberty of taking any other, when there is occasion. And there being one
  given him, before another Month is come in, he does without any scruple
  or delay comply therewith, presenting the Curious with an Experiment
  which he thinks is both seasonable, and will not be unwellcome to them;
  furnish't out of the Ample Magazin of that Philosophical Benefactor, the
  Noble Mr. <i>Boyle</i>; Concerning which, thus much is further thought
  requisite to intimate on this occasion, that it, and some others of the
  same Gentlemans, that have been, and may be, mentioned in the
  <i>Transactions</i>, belong to certain Treatises, the Author hath lying
  by him; but that yet he denys not <!-- Page 256 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page256"></a>{256}</span>to communicate them to
  his Friends, and to allow them to dispose thereof, upon a hope, that
  equitable Readers will be ready to excuse, if hereafter they should
  appear also in the Treatises they belong to, since he consents to this
  Anticipation, but to comply with those, that think the imparting of real
  and practical Experiments, may do the Publick some Service, by exciteing
  and assisting mens Curiosity in the interim.</p>

  <p>As for the Experiment, you saw the other day at my Lodgings, though it
  belongs to some Papers about <i>Cold</i>, that (you know) could not be
  Publish't, when the rest of the <i>History</i> came forth, and therefore
  was reserved for the next <i>Edition</i> of that Book; yet the Weather
  having been of late very hot, and threatning to continue so, I presume,
  that to give you here in compliance with your Curiosity an Account of the
  Main and Practical part of the Experiment, may enable you to gratify not
  onely the Curious among your Friends, but those of the Delicate, that are
  content to purchase a Coolness of Drinks at a somewhat chargeable
  rate.</p>

  <p>You may remember, that the Spring before the last, I shew'd you a
  particular Account of a way, wherein by a certain substance obtain'd from
  <i>Sal Armoniack</i>, I could presently produce a considerable degree of
  <i>Cold</i>, and that with odd Circumstances, without the help of
  <i>Snow</i>, <i>Ice</i>, <i>Niter</i> &amp;c. But that Experiment being
  difficult and costly enough, and design'd to afford men
  <i>Information</i>, not <i>Accomodations</i>, I afterwards tryed, what
  some more cheap and facile mixtures of likely Bodies with <i>Sal
  Armoniack</i> would do towards the Production of Cold, and afterwards I
  began to consider, whether to that purpose alone (for my first experiment
  was design'd to exhibite other <i>Phænomena</i> too) those mixtures might
  not without inconvenience be omitted: and I was much confirm'd in my
  conjecture, by an accident, which was casually related to me by a very
  Ingenious Physician of my acquaintance, but not to be repeated to you in
  few words, though he complain'd, he knew not what to make of it.</p>

  <p>Among the several ways, by which I have made infrigidating Mixtures
  with <i>Sal Armoniack</i>, the most simple and facile is this; Take one
  pound of powder'd <i>Sal Armoniack</i> and about three Pints (or pounds)
  of Water, put the Salt into the Liquor, <i>either</i> altogether, if your
  design be to produce an intense, though <!-- Page 257 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page257"></a>{257}</span>but a short coldness;
  <i>or</i> at two, three, or four several times, if you desire, that the
  produced coldness should rather last somewhat longer than be so great.
  Stirre the powder in the Liquor with a stick or whalebone (or some other
  thing that will not be injur'd by the fretting Brine, that will be made)
  to hasten the dissolution of the Salt; upon the quickness of which
  depends very much the intensity of the Cold, that will ensue upon this
  Experiment. For the clearing up whereof, I shall annex the following
  particulars.</p>

  <p>1. That a considerable degree of Cold is really produced by this
  operation, is very evident: <i>First</i> to the touch; <i>Secondly</i>,
  by this, that if you make the Experiment (as for this reason I sometimes
  chuse to do) in a Glass-Body or a Tankard, you <span class="sidenoter">*
  <i>In the History of Cold.</i></span> may observe, that, whilst the
  Solution of the Salt is making, the outside of the Metalline Vessel will,
  as high as the mixture reaches within, be bedew'd (if I may so speak)
  with a multitude of little Drops of Water as I have * elsewhere shown
  that it happens, when mixtures of Snow and Salt, being put into Glasses
  or other Vessels, the aqueous vapors that swim to and fro in the Air, and
  chance to glide along the sides of the Vessels, are by the coldness
  thereof condens'd into Water. And in our Armoniack Solution you may
  observe, that if you wipe off the Dew from any particular part of the
  outside of the Vessel, whilst the solution does yet vigorously goe on, it
  will quickly collect fresh Dew, which may be sometimes copious enough to
  run down the sides of the Vessel. But <i>Thirdly</i>, the best and surest
  way of finding out the Coldness of our Mixture is that, which I shew'd
  you by plunging into it a good seal'd Weatherglass furnish't with tincted
  Spirit of Wine. For the Ball of this being put into our frigorifick
  mixture, the Crimson Liquor will nimbly enough descend much lower, than
  when it was kept either in the open Air, in common Water, of the same
  temper with that, wherein the <i>Sal Armoniack</i> was put to dissolve.
  And if you remove the Glass out of our Mixture into common water, the
  tincted Spirit will, (as you may remember, it did) hastily enough
  reascend for a pretty while, according to the greater or lesser time,
  that it continued in the <i>Armoniack</i> Solution. And this has
  succeeded with me, when instead of removing the Mixture into
  <i>Common</i> Water, I removed it into water newly impregnated with
  <i>Salt-peter</i>.</p>

<p><!-- Page 258 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page258"></a>{258}</span></p>

  <p>2. The <i>Duration</i> of the Cold, produc'd by this Experiment,
  depends upon several Circumstances; as <i>First</i>, upon the Season of
  the year, and present temperature of the Air; For, in Summer and Hot
  weather the Cold will sooner decay and expire. <i>Secondly</i>, upon the
  Quantity of Salt and Water: For, if both these be great, the effect will
  be as well more lasting, as more considerable. <i>Thirdly</i>, for ought
  I yet know, we may here add the Goodness &amp; Fitness of the particular
  parcel of Salt, that is imploy'd; for, though it be hard to discern
  beforehand, which will be the more, and which the less proper; yet some
  trials have tempted me to suspect, that there may be a considerable
  disparity, as to their fitness to produce Cold, betwixt parcels of Salt,
  that are without scruple look't upon as Sal Armoniack: Of which
  difference it were not perhaps very difficult to asign probable reasons
  from the Nature of the Ingredients of this compound Concrete, and the
  wayes of preparing it. But the Duration of the Cold may be conceived to
  depend also. <i>Fourthly</i>, upon the Way of putting in the Salt into
  the Water. For, if you cast it in all at once, the Water will sooner
  acquire an intense degree of Coldness, but it will also the sooner return
  to its former temper; Whereas, if you desire but an inferiour degree of
  that Quality, but that may last longer (which wil usually be the most
  convenient for the Cooling of Drinks), then you may put in the Salt by
  little and little. For, keeping a long Weather-glass for a good while in
  our impregnated Mixture, I often purposely try'd, that, when the tincted
  liquor subsided but slowly, or was at a stand, by putting in, from time
  to time, 2 or 3. spoonfuls of fresh Salt, and stirring the Water to
  quicken the Dissolution, the Spirit of Wine would begin again to descend,
  if it were at a stand or rising, or subside much more swiftly than it did
  before. And if you would lengthen the Experiment, it may not be amiss,
  that part of the Sal Armoniack be but grosly beaten, that it may be the
  longer in dissolving, and consequently in Cooling the Water. Whilst there
  are dewy drops produced on the outside of the Vessel, 'tis a sign, that
  the Cold within continues pretty strong; for when it ceases, these drops
  especially in warm weather, will by degrees vanish. But a <i>surer</i>
  way of measuring the duration of the Cold, is, by removing from time to
  time the Seal'd Weather-glass out of the Saline Mixture into the same
  common Water, with part of which it was made. And though it be not easie
  to determin any thing particularly about this matter; yet it may somewhat
  assist you in your Estimates, to be inform'd, That I have in the Spring
  by a good Weather-glass found a sensible adventitious Cold made by a
  pound of Sal Armoniack at the utmost, to last about 2 or 3 hours.</p>

  <p>3. To cool Drinks with this Mixture, you may put them in <i>thin</i>
  Glasses, the thinner the better; which (their orifices being stopp'd, and
  still kept above the Mixture) may be moved to and fro in it, and then be
  immediately pour'd out to be drunk: Though when in the Glass, I imployed,
  was conveniently shap'd as, like a Sugar-loaf, or with a long Neck, I
  found it not amiss to drink it out of that, without pouring it into any
  other; which can scarce be done without lessning the Coolness. The
  refrigeration, if the Glass viall be convenient, is quickly perform'd:
  And if one have a mind to cool his hands, he may readily do it by
  applying them to the outside of the Vessel, that contains the
  refrigerating Mixture; by whose help, pieces of Chrystal, or Bullet for
  the cooling of <!-- Page 259 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page259"></a>{259}</span>the Mouths or Hands of those patients, to
  whom it may be allow'd, may be potently cool'd, and other such
  refreshments may be easily procur'd.</p>

  <p>4. How far Sal Armoniack, mingl'd with Sand or Earth, and not
  dissolv'd, but only moistn'd with a little Water sprinkl'd on it, will
  keep Bottles of Wine or other liquors more coole, than the Earth or that
  Sand alone will do, I have not yet had opportunity by sufficient trials
  fully to satisfie my self, and therefore resign that Enquiry to the
  Curious.</p>

  <p>5. For the cooling of Air, and Liquors, to adjust Weather-glasses (to
  be able to do which at all times of the year, was one of the chief aimes,
  that made me bethink my self of this Experiment;) or to give a small
  quantity of Beer &amp;c. a moderate degree of coolness, it will not be
  requisite, to employ neer so much as a whole pound of Sal Armoniack at a
  time. For, you may easily observe by a seal'd Weather-glass, that a very
  few ounces, well pouder'd and nimbly dissolv'd in about 4. times the
  weight of Water, will serve well enough for many purposes.</p>

  <p>6. And that you may the less, scruple at this, I shall tell you, that
  even before and after Midsummer, I have found the Cold producible by our
  Experiment to be considerable and useful for refrigerating of Drinks,
  &amp;c. but if the Sal Armoniack be of the fittest sort (for I intimated
  above, that I suspected, 'tis not equally good) and if the season of the
  year do make no disadvantagious difference, the degree of Cold, that may
  be produced by no more than one pound (if not by less) of Sal Armoniack,
  may, within its own Sphere of Activity, be much more vehement, than, I
  presume, you yet imagine, and may afford us excellent Standards to adjust
  seal'd Weather glasses by; and for several other purposes, For I remember
  that in the Spring, about the end of <i>March</i>, or beginning of
  <i>April</i>, I was able with one pound of Sal Armoniack, and a requisite
  proportion of Water, to produce a degree of Cold much greater, than was
  necessary the preceding Winter, to make it frosty Weather abroad; nay I
  was able to produce real Ice in a space of time, almost incredibly short.
  To confirm which particulars, because they will probably seem strange to
  you, I will here annex the Transcript of an entry, that I find in a Note
  book of the <i>Phænomena</i> and success of one of those Experiments, as
  I then tryed it; though I should be asham'd to expose to your perusal a
  thing so rudely pen'd; if I did not hope, you would consider, that 'twas
  hastily written onely for my own Remembrance. And that you may not stop
  at any thing in the immediately annext Note, or the two, that follow, it
  will be requisite to premise this Account of the seal'd Thermoscope;
  (which was a good one) wherewith these Observations were made; That the
  length of the Cylindrical pipe was 16. Inches; the Ball, about the
  bigness of a somewhat large Walnut, and the Cavity of the Pipe by guess
  about an eight or ninth part of an inch Diameter.</p>

  <p>The First Experiment is thus registered. <i>March</i> the 27th, in the
  Seal'd Weather glass, when first put into the Water, the tincted Spirit
  rested at 8&#x215D; inches; being suffered to stay there a good while,
  and now and then stirr'd to and fro in the Water; it descended at length
  a little beneath 7&#x215D; inches; then the <i>Sal Armoniack</i> being
  put in, within about a quarter of an hour or a little more it descended
  to 2<sup>11</sup>/<sub>16</sub> inches, but before that time, in half a
  <!-- Page 260 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page260"></a>{260}</span>quarter of an hour it began manifestly to
  freeze the vapours and drops of water on the outside of the Glass. And
  when the frigorifick power was arriv'd at the height, I several times
  found, that water, thinly plac'd on the outside, whilst the mixture
  within was nimbly stirr'd up and down, would freeze in a quarter of a
  minute (by a Minute-watch.) At about ¾ of an hour after the infrigidating
  Body was put in, the Thermoscope, that had been taken out a while before,
  and yet was risen but to the lowest freezing mark, being again put in the
  liquor, fell an inch beneath the mark. At about 2½ houres from the first
  Solution of the Salt I found the tincted liquor to be in the midst
  between the freezing marks, whereof the one was at 5½ inches (at which
  height when the Tincture rested, it would usually be, some, though but a
  small, frost abroad;) and the other at 4¾ inches; which was the height,
  to which strong and durable Frosts had reduced the liquor in the Winter.
  At 3 hours after the beginning of the Operation, I found not the Crimson
  liquor higher than the upper Freezing mark newly mention'd; after which,
  it continued to rise very slowly for about an hour longer; beyond which
  time I had not occasion to observe it.</p>

  <p>Thus far the <i>Note-book</i>; wherein there is mention made of a
  Circumstance of some former Experiments of the like kind, which I
  remember was very conspicuous in this newly recited. For, the frigorifick
  mixture having been made in a Glass body (as they call it) with a large
  and flattish bottom, a quantity of water, which I (purposely) spilt upon
  the Table, was by the operation of the mixture within the Glass, made to
  freeze, and that strongly enough, the bottom of the Cucurbite to the
  Table; that stagnant liquor being turn'd into solid ice, that continued a
  considerable while unthaw'd away, and was in some places about the
  thickness of a half Crown piece.</p>

  <p>Another Observation, made the same Spring, but less solemn, as meant
  chiefly to shew the Duration of Cold in a high degree, is recorded in
  these terms: The first time, the Seal'd Weather-glass was put in, before
  it touch'd the common water, it stood at 8&#x215B;, having been left
  there a considerable while, and once or twice agitated the water, the
  tincted liquor sunk but to 7&#x215E;, or at furthest,
  7<sup>6</sup>/<sub>8</sub>; then the frigorifick liquor being put into
  the water with circumstances disadvantagious enough in (about) half a
  quarter of an hour the tincted liquor fell beneath 3¾, and the
  Thermoscope, being taken out, and then put in again, an hour after the
  water had been first infrigidated subsided beneath 5 inches, and
  consequently within ¼ of an inch of the mark of the strongly freezing
  weather.</p>

  <p>7. Whereas the grand thing, that is like to keep this Experiment from
  being as generally <i>Useful</i>, as perhaps it will prove
  <i>Luciferous</i>, is the Dearness of Sal Armoniack, two things may be
  offered to lessen this Inconvenience. For <i>first</i>, Sal Armoniack
  might be made much cheaper, if instead of fetching it beyond-sea, our
  Country-men made it here at home; (which it may easily be and I am ready
  to give you the Receipt, which is no great Secret.) But <i>next</i>, I
  considered, that probably the infrigidating vertue of our mixture might
  depend upon the peculiar Texture of the Sal Armoniack whereby, whilest
  the Water is dissolving it, either some Frigorifick particles are
  extricated and excited or (rather) some particles which did before more
  agitate the minute parts of the water, are expell'd (or invited out by
  the ambient Bodies) or <!-- Page 261 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page261"></a>{261}</span>come to be clogg'd in their motion: Whence
  it seem'd reasonable to expect that upon the Reunion of the Saline
  particles into such a Body, as they had constituted before, the
  redintegrated Sal Armoniack having, neer upon, the same Texture, would,
  upon its being redissolv'd, produce the same, or a not much inferior
  degree of Coldness: And hereupon, though I well enough foresaw that an
  Armoniack solution, being boyl'd up in Earthen vessels (for Glass ones
  are too chargeable) would, by piercing them, both lose some of the more
  subtle parts, and thereby somewhat impaire the texture of the rest; yet I
  was not deceiv'd in Expecting, that the dry Salt, remaining in the
  pipkins, being redissolv'd in a due proportion of water, would very
  considerably infrigidate it; as may further appear by the Notes, which
  for your greater satisfaction you will find here subjoyn'd, as soon as I
  have told you, that, though for want of other vessels I was first reduc'd
  to make use of Earthen ones, and the rather, because some Metallin
  Vessels will be injur'd by the dissolv'd Sal Armoniack, if it be boyl'd
  in them; yet I afterwards found some conveniencies in Vessels of other
  Mettall, as of Iron; whereof you may command a further Account.</p>

  <p><i>March</i> the 29th, the Thermoscope in the Air was at 8&#x215E;
  inches; being put into a somewhat large evaporating glass, fill'd with
  water, it fell (after it staid a pretty while, and had been agitated in
  the liquor) to 8. inches: then about half the Salt, or less, that had
  been used <i>twice</i> before, and felt much less cold than the water,
  being put in and stirr'd about, the tincted Spirit subsided with a
  visible progress, till it was faln manifestly beneath 4. inches; and
  then, having caused some water to be freshly pump'd and brought in;
  though the newly mention'd Solution were mixt with it, yet it presently
  made the Spirit of Wine manifestly to ascend in the Instrument, much
  faster, than one would have expected, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

  <p>And this much may suffice for this time concerning our
  <i>Frigorifick</i> Experiment; which I scarce doubt but the
  <i>Cartesians</i> will lay hold on as very favourable to some of their
  Tenents; which you will easily believe, it is <i>not</i> to the Opinion,
  I have elsewhere oppos'd, of those Modern Philosophers, that would have
  <i>Salt-petre</i> to be the <i>Primum Frigidum</i>: (though I found by
  trial, that, whilst 'tis actually dissolving, it gives a much
  considerabler degree of Cold, than otherwise.) But about the Reflexions,
  that may be made on this Experiment, and the Variations, and Improvements
  &amp; Uses of it, though I have divers things lying by me; yet, since you
  have seen several of them already, and may command a sight of the rest, I
  shall forbear the mention of them here, not thinking it proper, to swell
  the bulk of this Letter with them.</p>

  <p>II. <i>THE ENGLISH VINE-YARD VINDICATED.</i> The Author (Mr. <i>John
  Rose</i>, his Majesties Gardener at his Royal Garden in St.
  <i>James</i>'s) makes it his business in this small Tract (a very thin
  Pocket-book) by a few short Observations made by himself, to direct
  <i>Englishmen</i> in the <i>Choice</i> of the <i>Fruit</i>, and the
  <i>Planting</i> of Vine-yards; heretofore very frequently cultivated,
  though of late almost quite neglected by them.</p>

  <p>He discourses skilfully, 1. Of the <i>severall sorts</i> of
  <i>Vines</i>, and what <i>Grapes</i> are most sutable to the
  <i>Climate</i> of <i>England</i>; where he chiefly commends the small
  <i>Black-grape</i>, or <i>Cluster-grape</i>; the <i>Parsley-grape</i>;
  the White <i>Muscadine</i>; the <i>Frontiniack</i>; and a new
  <i>White-grape</i>, with a red Wood and a dark green Leaf: All these
  being early ripe fruit. 2. Of the <i>Soyle</i>, and <i>Scituation</i> of
  a Vine-yard in <i>England</i>: Where, as to the <i>First</i>, he pitches
  upon a <i>Light Soile</i>, having a bottom of <i>Chalk</i> or
  <i>Gravel</i>, and given to <i>Brambles</i> observing, that no Plant
  whatsoever is so connatural to the Vine for Soyl, as the <i>Bramble</i>.
  As for the <i>Scituation</i> he chooses that side or declivity of a Hill,
  that lies to the <i>South</i> or <i>Southwest</i>; and is favoured with
  <i>other Hills</i> somewhat higher, or <i>Woods</i> on the <i>North</i>
  and <i>East</i>, to break the rigour of those quarters. This direction he
  thinks of that importance, that he affirms, that the discouragement of
  the Culture of Vines in <i>England</i> has only proceeded from men's
  misinformation on this material article of <i>Choice</i> of <i>Soyle</i>
  and <i>Scituation</i>. 3. How to <i>prepare</i> the Ground for the
  Plantation, <i>vid.</i> by plowing up the <i>Swarth</i> in <i>July</i>,
  and by disposing the <i>Turf</i> in <i>small</i> heaps, and so burning
  them, and spreading the ashes over the Land; care being taken, that by
  heaping too much materials together, the Earth be not over-burnt by the
  excessive heat and fire, which they require to reduce them to ashes.</p>

  <p>What is added, of the Manner of planting the <i>Sets</i>; of Dressing,
  Pruning, and Governing the Plantation; of the Ordering and Cultivating
  the Vine-yard after the first four years, till it needs renewing; as also
  of the <i>manner</i> and <i>time</i>, how and when to manure the
  Vine-yard, with Compost, will be better understood from the Book it self,
  than can be here described; the Author pretending, that, those few
  observations of his, as the native production of his own Experience,
  being practised with care, the Vine-yards in <i>England</i> may be
  planted, govern'd and perpetuated with undoubted success; and offering
  withall to furnish those, that have a desire to renew this Culture, and
  to store their grounds with <i>Sets</i> and <i>Plants</i> of all those
  sorts, which he recommends; he having a plentiful <i>stock</i> of them
  all.</p>

<h3><i>An Essay
of Dr. </i>John Wallis<i>, exhibiting his </i>Hypothesis<i> about the
</i>Flux and Reflux of the Sea<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>How abstruse a subject in Philosophy, the <i>Flux and Reflux of the
  Sea</i> hath proved hitherto, and how much the same hath in all Ages
  perplexed the Minds even of the best of <i>Naturalists</i>, when they
  have attempted to render an Account of the Cause thereof, is needless
  here to represent. It may perhaps be to more purpose, to take notice,
  that all the deficiencies, found in the <i>Theories</i> or
  <i>Hypotheses</i>, formerly invented for that End, have not been able to
  deterre the Ingenious of <i>this</i> Age from making farther search into
  that Matter: Among whom that Eminent Mathematician Dr. <i>John
  Wallis</i>, following his happy <i>Genius</i> for advancing reall
  Philosophy, hath made it a part of his later Inquiries and Studies, to
  contrive and deduce a certain Hypothesis concerning that
  <i>Phænomenon</i>, taken <!-- Page 264 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page264"></a>{264}</span>from the Consideration of the <i>Common
  Center of Gravity of the Earth and Moon</i>, This being by several
  Learned Men lookt upon, as a very rational Notion, it was thought fit to
  offer it by the Press to the Publick, that other Intelligent Persons also
  might the more conveniently and at their leisure examine the
  <i>Conjecture</i> (the Author, such is his Modesty, presenting it no
  otherwise) and thereupon give in their sense, and what Difficulties may
  occur to them about it, that so it may be either confirm'd or laid aside
  accordingly; As the <i>Proposer</i> himself expressly desires in the
  Discourse, we now, without any more <i>Preamble</i>, are going to
  subjoyn, as it was by him addressed, by way of Letter, from <i>Oxford</i>
  to Mr. <i>Boyle, April</i> 25. 1666. and afterwards communicated to the
  <i>R. Society</i>, as follows:</p>

  <p>You were earnest with me, when you last went from hence, that I would
  put in writing somewhat of that, which at divers times, these three or
  four years last past, I have been discoursing with your self and others
  concerning the <i>Common Center of Gravity of the Earth and Moon</i>, in
  order to salving the <i>Phænomena</i> as well of the <i>Seas Ebbing and
  Flowing</i>; as of some perplexities in <i>Astronomical Observations</i>
  of the <i>Places</i> of the Celestial Bodies.</p>

  <p>How much the World, and the great Bodies therein, are manag'd
  according to the <i>Laws of Motion</i>, and <i>Statick Principles</i>,
  and with how much more of clearness and satisfaction, many of the more
  abstruse <i>Phænomena</i> have been salved on such Principles, within
  this last Century of years, than formerly they had been; I need not
  discourse to you, who are well versed in it. For, since that
  <i>Galilæo</i> and (after him) <i>Torricellio</i>, and others, have
  applied <i>Mechanick</i> Principles to the salving of
  <i>Philosophical</i> Difficulties; <i>Natural Philosophy</i> is well
  known to have been rendered more intelligible, and to have made a much
  greater progress in less than an hundred years, than before for many
  ages.</p>

  <p>The <i>Seas Ebbing and Flowing</i>, hath so great a connexion with the
  <i>Moons</i> motion, that in a manner all Philosophers (whatever other
  Causes they have joyned with it), have attributed much of its cause to
  the <i>Moon</i>, which either by some <i>occult quality</i>, <!-- Page
  265 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page265"></a>{265}</span>or
  <i>particular influence</i>, which it hath on moyst Bodies, or by some
  <i>Magnetick vertue</i>, drawing the water towards it, (which should
  therefore make the Water there <i>highest</i>, where the Moon is
  <i>vertical</i>) or by its gravity and pressure downwards upon the
  Terraqueous Globe (which would make it <i>lowest</i> where the Moon is
  <i>vertical</i>) or by whatever other means (according to the several
  Conjectures of inquisitive persons,) hath so great an influence on, or at
  least a connexion with, the Sea's Flux and Reflux, that it would seem
  very unreasonable, to seclude the consideration of the Moons motion from
  that of the Sea: The <i>Periods of Tides</i> (to say nothing of the
  greatness of them near the New moon and Full moon) so constantly waiting
  on the Moon's motion, that it may be well presumed, that either the one
  is governed by the other, or at least both from some common cause.</p>

  <p>But the first that I know of, who took in the consideration of the
  <i>Earth's</i> motion, (<i>Diurnal</i> and <i>Annual</i>) was
  <i>Galilæo</i>; who in his <i>Systeme of the World</i>, hath a particular
  discourse on this subject: Which, from the first time I ever read it,
  seemed to me so very rational, that I could never be of other opinion,
  but that the true Account of this great <i>Phænomenon</i> was to be
  referred to the Earths motion, as the <i>Principal</i> cause of it: Yet
  that of the Moon (for the reasons above mentioned) not to be excluded, as
  to the determining the <i>Periods of Tides</i>, and other circumstances
  concerning them. And though it be manifest enough, that <i>Galilæo</i>,
  as to some particulars, was mistaken in the account which there he gives
  of it; yet that may be very well allowed, without any blemish to so
  deserving a person, or prejudice to the <i>main Hypothesis</i>: For that
  Discourse is to be looked upon onely as an <i>Essay</i> of the <i>general
  Hypothesis</i>; which as to <i>particulars</i> was to afterwards
  adjusted, from a good <i>General History of Tides</i>; which it's
  manifest enough that he had not; and which is in a great measure yet
  wanting. For were the matter of Fact well agreed on, it is not likely,
  that several Hypotheses should so far differ, as that one should make the
  Water <i>then</i> and <i>there</i> at the Highest, <i>where</i> and
  <i>when</i> the other makes it at the Lowest; as when the Moon is
  Vertical to the place. <!-- Page 266 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page266"></a>{266}</span></p>

  <p>And what I say of <i>Galilæo</i>, I must in like manner desire to be
  understood of what I am now ready to say to you. For I do not profess to
  be so well skilled in the History of Tides, as that I will undertake
  presently to accommodate my <i>general Hypothesis</i> to the
  <i>particular cases</i>; or that I will indeed undertake for the
  certainty of it, but onely as an <i>Essay</i> propose it to further
  consideration; to stand or fall, as it shall be found to answer matter of
  Fact. And truly had not your importunity (which is to me a great Command)
  required me to do it, I should not so easily have drawn up any thing
  about it, till I had first satisfied my selfe, how well the Hypothesis
  would answer Observation: Having for divers years neglected to do it,
  waiting a time when I might be at leisure throughly to prosecute this
  design.</p>

  <p>But there be two reasons, by which you have prevailed with me, at
  least to do something. <i>First</i>, because it is the common Fate of the
  <i>English</i>, that out of a modesty, they forbear to publish their
  Discoveries, till prosecuted to some good degree of certainty and
  perfection; yet are not so wary, but that they discourse of them freely
  enough to one another, and even to Strangers upon occasion; whereby
  others, who are more hasty and venturous, comming to hear of the notion,
  presently publish something of it, and would be reputed thereupon, to be
  the first Inventers thereof: though even that little, which they can then
  say of it, be perhaps much less, and more imperfect, than what the true
  Authors could have published long before, and what they had really made
  known (publikely enough, though not in print) to many others. As is well
  known amongst us as to the business of the <i>Lymphatick Vessels</i> in
  <i>Anatomy</i>; the <i>Injection of Liquors into the veins of Living
  animals</i>; the <i>Exhibiting of a straight line equal to a crooked</i>;
  the <i>spot in Jupiter</i>, whence his motion about his own Axis may be
  demonstrated; and many other the like considerable Inventions.</p>

  <p>The <i>other</i> Reason (which, with me, is more really of weight,
  though even the former be not cotemptible) is, because, as I have been
  already for at least three or four years last past diverted from
  prosecuting the inquiry or perfecting the Hypothesis, as I had thoughts
  to do; so I do not know, but like Emergencies may divert me longer; and
  whether I shall ever so <!-- Page 267 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page267"></a>{267}</span>do it, as to bring it to perfection, I
  cannot determine. And therefore, if as to my self any thing should
  <i>humanitus accidere</i>; yet possibly the notion may prove worth the
  preserving to be prosecuted by others, if I do it not. And therefore I
  shall, at least to your self, give some general account of my present
  imperfect and undigested thoughts.</p>

  <p>I consider therefore, that in the Tides, or the Flux and Reflux of the
  Sea, besides extraordinary Extravagancies or Irregularities, whence great
  Inundations or strangly high Tides do follow, (which yet perhaps may
  prove not to be so meerly accidental as they have been thought to be, but
  might from the regular Laws of Motion, if well considered, be both well
  accounted for and even foretold;) There are these <i>three</i> notorious
  Observations made of the Reciprocation of Tides. <i>First</i>, the
  <i>Diurnal</i> Reciprocation; whereby twice in somewhat more than 24.
  hours, we have a Floud and an Ebbe; or a High-water and Low-water.
  <i>Secondly</i>, the <i>Menstrual</i>; whereby in one <i>Synodical</i>
  period of the Moon, suppose from Full-moon to Full-moon, the Time of
  those Diurnal Vicissitudes doth move round through the whole compass of
  the <span title="Nuchthêmeron" class="grk"
  >&Nu;&upsilon;&chi;&theta;&#x1F75;&mu;&epsilon;&rho;&omicron;&nu;</span>,
  or Natural day of twenty four hours: As for instance, if at the Full-moon
  the full Sea be at such or such a place just at Noon, it shall be the
  next day (at the same place) somewhat before One of the clock; the day
  following, between One and Two; and so onward, till at the New moon it
  shall be at midnight; (the other Tide, which in the Full moon was at
  midnight, now at the New-moon coming to be at noon;) And so forward till
  at the next Full-moon, the Full sea shall (at the same place) come to be
  at Noon again: Again, That of the Spring-tides and Neap-tides (as they
  are called;) about the Full-moon and New-moon the Tides are at the
  Highest, at the Quadratures the Tides are at the Lowest: And at the times
  intermediate, proportionably. <i>Thirdly</i>, the <i>Annual</i>; whereby
  it is observed, that at sometimes of the year, the Spring-tides are yet
  much higher than the Spring-tides at other times of the year: Which Times
  are usually taken to be at the Spring and Autumne; or the two Æquinoxes;
  but I have reason to believe (as well from my own Observations, for many
  years, as of others who have been <!-- Page 268 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page268"></a>{268}</span>much concerned to heed
  it, whereof more will be said by and by;) that we should rather assign
  the beginnings of <i>February</i> and <i>November</i>, than the two
  <i>Æquinoxes</i>.</p>

  <p>Now in order to the giving account of these three Periods, according
  to the <i>Laws of Motion</i> and <i>Mechanick Principles</i>; We shall
  <i>first</i> take for granted, what is now adayes pretty commonly
  entertained by those, who treat of such matters; <i>That a Body in motion
  is apt to continue its motion, and that in the same degree of celerity,
  unless hindred by some contrary Impediment</i>; (like as a Body at rest,
  to continue so, unless by some sufficient mover, put into motion:) And
  accordingly (which daily experience testifies) if on a Board or Table,
  some loose incumbent weight, be for some time moved, &amp; have thereby
  contracted an <i>Impetus</i> to motion at such a rate; if that Board or
  Table chance by some external obstacle, or otherwise, to be stopped or
  considerably retarded in its motion, the incumbent loose Body will shoot
  forward upon it: And contrarywise, in case that Board or Table chance to
  be accelerated or put forward with a considerably greater speed than
  before, the loose incumbent Body, (not having yet obtained an equal
  <i>Impetus</i> with it) will be left behind, or seem to fly backward upon
  it. Or, (which is <i>Galilæo</i>'s instance,) if a broad Vessel of Water,
  for some time evenly carried forward with the water in it, chance to meet
  with a stop, or to slack its motion, the Water will dash forward and rise
  higher at the fore part of the Vessel: And, contrarywise, if the Vessel
  be suddenly put forward faster than before; the Water will dash
  backwards, and rise at the hinder part of the Vessel. So that an
  Acceleration or Retardation of the Vessel, which carries it, will cause a
  rising of the Water in one part, and a falling in another: (which yet, by
  its own weight, will again be reduced to a Level as it was before.) And
  consequently, supposing the Sea to be but as a loose Body, carried about
  with the Earth, but not so united with it, as necessarily to receive the
  same degree of <i>Impetus</i> with it, as its fixed parts do: The
  acceleration or retardation in the motion of this or that part of the
  Earth, will cause (more or less, according to the proportion of it) such
  a dashing of the Water, or rising at one part, with a Falling at another,
  as is that, which we call the Flux and Reflux of the Sea. <!-- Page 269

      alt="Fig. 1." title="Fig. 1." /></a>
  </div>
  <p>Now this premised, We are next, with him, to suppose the Earth carried
  about with a double motion; The one <i>Annual</i>, as (<i>Fig.</i> 1.) in
  B E C the great Orb, in which the Center of the Earth B, is supposed to
  move about the Sun A.</p>

  <p>The other <i>Diurnal</i>, whereby the whole moves upon its own
  <i>Axis</i>, and each point in its surface describes a Circle, as D E F
  G.</p>

  <p>It is then manifest, that if we suppose, that the Earth moved but by
  any one of these motions, and that regularly, (with an equal swiftness;)
  the Water, having once attained an equal <i>Impetus</i> thereunto, would
  still hold equal pace with it; there being no occasion, from the
  Quickening or Slackening of the Earths motion, (in that part where the
  Water lyeth) for the Water thereon either to be cast Forward or fall
  Backward; and thereby to accumulate on the other parts of the Water: But
  the true motion of each part of the Earths surface being compounded of
  those two motions, the <i>Annual</i> and <i>Diurnal</i>; (the
  <i>Annual</i> in B E C being, as <i>Galilæo</i> there supposeth, about
  three times as fast as a <i>diurnal</i> motion in a great Circle, as D E
  F;) while a Point in the Earths surface moves about its Center B. from G.
  to D. and E. and at the same time, its Center B. be carried forwards to
  C; the true motion of that Point forwards, is made up of both those
  motions; to wit, of B to C, and of G to E; but while G moves by D to E, E
  moves backward by F to G, contrary to the motion of B to C; so that the
  true motion of E, is but the difference of B C, and E G: (for, beside the
  <span class="correction" title="Original reads `motion of B, the Center G is also', corrected by errata, page 310."
  >motion of B above the Center; G. is also</span> put forward as much as
  from G to E; and E put backward as much as from E to G:) so that the
  <i>Diurnal</i> motion, in that part of the Earth, which is next the Sun,
  as E F G, doth abate the progress of the <i>Annual</i>, (and most of all
  at F;) and in the other part, which is from the Sun, as G D E, it doth
  increase it, (and most of all at D.) that is, in the day time there is
  abated, in the night time is added to the <i>Annual</i> motion, about as
  much as is G E, the Earths <i>Diameter</i>. Which would afford us a Cause
  of two Tides in twenty four hours; the One upon the greatest Acceleration
  of motion, the Other upon its greatest Retardation.</p>

  <p>And thus far <i>Galilæo</i>'s Discourse holds well enough; But then
  <!-- Page 270 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page270"></a>{270}</span>in this it comes short; that as it gives
  an Account of two Tides; so those two Tides are alwayes to be at F and D;
  that is, at <i>Noon</i> and <i>Midnight</i>; whereas Experience tells us,
  that the Time of Tides, moves in a <i>moneths space</i> through all the
  24. hours. Of which he gives us no account. For though he do take notice
  of a Menstrual Period; yet he doth it onely as to the <i>Quantity</i> of
  the Tides; greater or less; not as to the <i>Time</i> of the
  <i>Tides</i>, sooner or later.</p>

<div class="sidenoter">* <i>Vid. Riccioli Almagest. novum</i>, Tom. 1, lib. 4. cap. 10. n. 111. pag. 216. 2.</div>
  <p>To help this, there is one (<i>Vid.* Jo. Baptista Balianus</i>) who
  makes the <i>Earth</i> to be but a <i>secondary</i> Planet; and to move,
  not directly about the Sun, but about the Moon, the Moon meanwhile moving
  about the Sun; in like manner as we suppose the Earth to move about the
  Sun, and the Moon about it.</p>

  <p>But this, though it might furnish us with the foundation of a
  <i>Menstrual</i> Period of Accelerations and Retardations in the compound
  motion of several parts of the Earths surface; yet I am not at all
  inclined to admit this as a <i>true Hypothesis</i>, for divers Reasons,
  which if not demonstrative, are yet so consonant to the general Systeme
  of the World, as that we have no good ground to disbelieve them. For 1.
  The Earth being undeniably the greater Body of the two (whereof there is
  no doubt to be made) it cannot be thought probable, that this should be
  carried about by the Moon, lesser than it self: The contrary being seen,
  not onely in the <i>Sun</i>, which is bigger than any of the Planets,
  which it carryes about; but in <i>Jupiter</i>, bigger than any of his
  <i>Satellites</i>; and <i>Saturne</i>, bigger than his. 2. As the
  <i>Sun</i> by it's motion about it's own Axis, is with good reason judged
  to be the <i>Physical</i> cause of the <i>Primary</i> Planets moving
  about it; So there is the like reason to believe, that <i>Jupiter</i> and
  <i>Saturne</i> moving about their Axes, are the Physical cause of their
  <i>Satellites</i> moving about them, which motion of <i>Jupiter</i> hath
  been of late discover'd, by the help of a <i>fixed</i> Spot discern'd in
  him; and we have reason to believe the like of <i>Saturne:</i> Whether
  <i>Venus</i> and <i>Mercury</i> (about whom no <i>Satellites</i> have
  been yet observed) be likewise so moved; we have not yet the like ground
  to determine: But we have of <i>Mars</i>; from <!-- Page 271 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page271"></a>{271}</span>the Observations of Mr.
  <i>Hook</i> made in <i>February</i> and <i>March</i> last, and by him
  communicated to the <i>Royal Society</i>, and since Printed in the
  <i>Transactions</i>, published <i>Apr.</i> 2. 1666. consonant to the like
  observations of <i>Jupiter</i>, made by him in <i>May.</i> 1664, and
  since communicated to the same <i>Society</i>; and then published in the
  <i>Transactions</i>, of <i>March.</i> 6. then next following. Now that
  the Earth hath such a motion about its own <i>Axis</i> (whereby it might
  be fitted to carry about the Moon) is evident by its <i>Diurnal</i>
  motion. And it seems as evident that the Moon hath not; because of the
  same side of the Moon alwaies turned towards us; which could not be, if
  the Moon carried the Earth about: Unlesse we should say, that it carries
  about the Earth in just the same Period, in which it turnes upon its own
  Axis: Which is contrary to that of the Sun carrying about the Planets:
  the shortest of whose Periods, is yet longer than that of the Suns moving
  about its own Axis. And the like of <i>Jupiter</i>, shorter than the
  Period of any of his <i>Satellites</i>; if at least the Period of his
  conversion about his Axis, lately said to be observed, prove true. (Of
  <i>Saturn</i> we have not yet any Period assigned; but it's likely to be
  shorter, than that of his <i>Satelles</i>.) And therefore we have reason
  to believe, not that by the Moons motion about its Axis the Earth should
  be carried by a contemporary Period (whereby the same face of the Moon
  should be ever towards us;) but that by the Earths revolution about its
  Axis in 24. hours, the Moon should be carried about it in about 29.
  dayes, without any motion on its own Axis: And accordingly, that the
  <i>Secondary</i> Planets about <i>Jupiter</i> and <i>Saturn</i>, are not
  (like their <i>Principals</i>) turned about their own Axis. And therefore
  I am not at all inclined to believe, that the <i>Menstrual</i> Period of
  the Tides with us, is to be salved by such an Hypothesis.</p>

  <p>In stead of this, that <i>Surmise</i> of mine, (for I dare not yet,
  with confidence give it any better name,) of what I have spoken to you
  heretofore, (and which hath occasioned this present account which I am
  now giving you,) is to this purpose.</p>

  <p>The Earth and Moon being known to be Bodies of so great connexion
  (whether by any Magnetick, or what other Tye, I will not determine; nor
  need I, as to this purpose;) as that <!-- Page 272 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page272"></a>{272}</span>the motion of the one
  follows that of the other; (The Moon observing the Earth as the Center of
  its <i>periodick</i> motion:) may well enough be looked upon as <i>one
  Body</i>, or rather <i>one Aggregate of Bodies</i>, which have <i>one
  common center of Gravity</i>; which Center (according to the known Laws
  of <i>Staticks</i>) is in a streight Line connecting their respective
  Centers, so divided as that its parts be in reciprocal proportion to the
  Gravities of the two Bodies. As for Example; Suppose the Magnitude (and
  therefore probably, the Gravity) of the Moon to be about an <i>One and
  fourtieth part</i> of that of the Earth; (and thereabouts <i>Hevelius</i>
  in his <i>Selenography</i> page 203. doth out of <i>Tycho</i>, estimate
  the proportion; and an exact certainty is not necessary to our present
  businesse.) And the distance of the Moons Center from the Center of the
  Earth, to be about <i>fifty six Semidiameters</i> of the Earth, (as
  thereabouts he doth there estimate it, in its middle distance; and we
  need not be now very accurate in determining the numbers; wherein
  Astronomers are not yet very well agreed.) The distance of the Common
  Center of Gravity of the two Bodies, will be from that of the Earth,
  about a two and fourtieth part of fifty six Semidiameters; that is, about
  <sup>56</sup>/<sub>42</sub> or <sup>4</sup>/<sub>3</sub> of a
  Semidiameter; that is about &#x2153; of a Semidiameter of the Earth,
  above its surface, in the Air, directly between the Earth and Moon.</p>

  <p>Now supposing the Earth and Moon, joyntly as one Body, carried about
  by the Sun in the great Orb of the <i>Annual</i> motion; this motion is
  to be estimated, (according to the Laws of <i>Staticks</i>, in other
  cases,) by the motion of the common Center of Gravity of both Bodies. For
  we use in <i>Staticks</i>, to estimate a Body, or Aggregate of Bodies, to
  be moved upwards, downwards, or otherwise, so much as its Common Center
  of Gravity is so moved, howsoever the parts may change places amongst
  themselves.</p>

  <p>And accordingly, the Line of the <i>Annual</i> motion, (whether
  <i>Circular</i> or <i>Elliptical</i>; of which I am not here to dispute,)
  will be described, not by the Center of the Earth (as we commonly
  estimate it, making the Earth a Primary and the Moon a Secondary Planet,)
  nor by the Center of the Moon, (as they would do, who make the Moon the
  Primary and the Earth a <!-- Page 273 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page273"></a>{273}</span>Secondary Planet, against which we were
  before disputing:) But by the <i>Common Center of Gravity of the Bodies,
  Earth and Moon</i>, as one Aggregate.</p>

<div class="sidenoter">See Fig. 2. and 3.</div>
  <p>Now supposing A B C D E to be a part of the great Orb of the
  <i>Annual</i> motion, described by the Common Center of Gravity, in so
  long time as from a <i>Full-Moon</i> at A to the next <i>New-Moon</i> at
  E; (which, though an Arch of a <i>Circle</i> or <i>Ellipse</i>, whose
  Center we suppose at a due distance below it; yet being put about
  <sup>1</sup>/<sub>25</sub> of the whole, may well enough be here
  represented by a streight Line:) the Center of the Earth at T, and that
  of the Moon at L, must each of them (supposing their common Center of
  Gravity to keep the Line A E) be supposed to describe a <i>Periphery</i>
  about that Common Center, as the Moon describes her Line of
  <i>Menstrual</i> motion (Of which I have (in the <i>Scheme</i>) onely
  drawn that of the <i>Earth</i>; as being sufficient to our present
  purpose; parallel to which, if need be, we may suppose one described by
  the Moon; whose distance is also to be supposed much greater from T than
  in the <i>figure</i> is expressed, or was necessary to expresse.) And in
  like manner E F G H I, from that <i>New moon</i> at E, to the next
  <i>Full-moon</i> at I.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:44%;">
      <a href="images/VI_N16_Figs23.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/VI_N16_Figs23.png"
      alt="Figs. 2. and 3." title="Figs. 2. and 3." /></a>
  </div>
  <p>From A to E (from Full moon to New moon,) T moves (in its own
  <i>Epicycle</i>) upwards from the Sun: And from E to I, (from New moon to
  Full moon) it moves downwards, toward the Sun. Again, from C to G, (from
  last quarter to the following first quarter,) it moves <i>forwards
  according</i> to the <i>Annual</i> motion; But from G forward to C, (from
  the first Quarter to the ensuing last Quarter,) it moves <i>contrary</i>
  to the <i>Annual</i> motion.</p>

  <p>It is manifest therefore, according to this Hypothesis, that from Last
  quarter to First quarter (from C to G, while T is above the Line of the
  <i>Annual</i> motion) its <i>Menstrual</i> motion in its Epicycle
  <i>adds</i> somewhat of Acceleration to the <i>Annual</i> motion, and
  most of all at E, the New-moon: And from the first to the last quarter
  (from G forward to C, while T is below the Line of the <i>Annual</i>
  motion,) it <i>abates</i> of the <i>Annual</i> motion; and most of all at
  I, or A the Full-moon.</p>

  <p>So that in pursuance of <i>Galilæo's</i> Notion, the <i>Menstrual</i>
  <!-- Page 274 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page274"></a>{274}</span>adding to or detracting from the
  <i>Annual</i> motion, should either leave behinde, or cast forward, the
  loose waters incumbent on the Earth, (and thereby cause a Tide, or
  accumulation of Waters) and most of all at the Full Moon and New-moon,
  where those Accelerations or Retardations are greatest.</p>

  <p>Now this <i>Menstrual</i> motion, if nothing else were superadded to
  the <i>Annual</i>, would give us two Tides in a moneth, and no more; (the
  one upon the Acceleration, the other on the Retardation;) at New moon and
  Full-moon; and two Ebbs, at the two Quarters; and in the Intervals,
  Rising and Falling water.</p>

  <p>But the <i>Diurnal</i> motion superadded, doth the same to this
  <i>Menstrual</i>, which <i>Galilæo</i> supposeth <span class="correction"
  title="Original reads `is to do to that', corrected by errata, page 310."
  >it to do to the</span> <i>Annual</i>; that is, doth <i>Add</i> to, or
  <i>Subtract</i> from, the <i>Menstrual</i> Acceleration or Retardation;
  and so gives us Tide upon Tide.</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:17%;">
      <a href="images/VI_N16_Fig4.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/VI_N16_Fig4.png"
      alt="Fig. 4." title="Fig. 4." /></a>
  </div>
  <p>For in whatsoever part of its Epicycle, we suppose T to be; yet
  because, while by its <i>Menstrual</i> motion the Center moves in the
  Circle L T N; each point in its surface, by its diurnal motion moves in
  the Circle L M N: whatever effect (accelerative or tardative) the
  <i>Menstrual</i> would give, that effect by the <i>Diurnal</i> is
  increased in the parts L M N (or rather l M n. the Semicircle) and most
  of all at M: but diminished in the parts N O L (or rather n O l) and most
  of all at O. So that at M, and O, (that is when the Moon is in the
  <i>Meridian</i> below or above the <i>Horizon</i>,) we are to have the
  Diurnal Tide or High-water, occasioned by the greatest Acceleration or
  Retardation, which the <i>Diurnal</i> Arch gives to that of the
  <i>Menstrual</i>: which seems to be the true cause of the <i>Daily
  Tides</i>. And withall gives an account, not onely why it should be
  <i>every</i> day; but like wise, why at <i>such a time</i> of the day;
  and why this time should in a moneth run through the whole 24 hours;
  <i>viz.</i> because the Moons coming to the <i>Meridian</i> above and
  below the <i>Horizon</i>, (or as the Seamen call it, the <i>Moons
  Southing</i>, and <i>Northing</i>,) doth so: As likewise of the <i>Spring
  tides</i> and <i>Neap-tides</i>. For, when it so happens, that the
  <i>Menstrual</i> and <i>Diurnal</i> Accelerations or Retardations, be
  coincident, (as at New moons and Full-moons they are,) the effect must
  needs be the greater. And although (which is not to be dissembled) this
  happen <!-- Page 275 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page275"></a>{275}</span>but to one of the two Tides; that is, the
  Night-tide at the New-moon (when both motions do most of all Accelerate,)
  and the Day-tide at Full-moon (when both do most Retard the <i>Annual</i>
  motion;) Yet, this tide being thus raised by two concurrent causes;
  though the next Tide have not the same cause also, the <i>Impetus</i>
  contracted will have influence upon the next Tide; Upon a like reason, as
  a <i>Pendulum</i> let fall from a higher Arch, will (though there be no
  new cause to occasion it) make the Vibration on the other side (beyond
  the Perpendicular) to be also greater: Or, of water in a broad Vessel, if
  it be so jogged, as to be cast forward to a good height above its Levell,
  will upon its recoyling, by its own gravity, (without any additional
  cause) mount so much the higher on the hinder part.</p>

  <p>But here also we are to take notice, that though all parts of the
  Earth by its <i>Diurnal</i> motion do turn about its Axis, and describe
  <i>parallel</i> Circles; yet not <i>equal</i> Circles; but <i>greater</i>
  neer the <i>Æquinoctial</i>, and <i>lesser</i> near the <i>Poles</i>,
  which may be a cause why the Tides in some parts may be much greater than
  in others. But this belongs to the <i>particular</i> considerations, (of
  which we are not now giving an Account:) not to the <i>general</i>
  Hypothesis.</p>

  <p>Having thus endeavoured to give an account of the <i>Diurnal</i> and
  <i>Menstrual</i> Periods of Tides; It remains that I endeavour the like
  as to the <i>Annual</i>. Of which there is, at least, thus much agreed;
  That, at some times of the year, the Tides are noted to be much higher,
  than at other times.</p>

  <p>But here I have a double task; <i>First</i>, to rectify the
  Observation; and <i>then</i>, to give an account of it.</p>

  <p>As to the <i>First</i>; It having been observed (grosly) that those
  high Tides have used to happen about the <i>Spring</i> and <i>Autumn</i>;
  it hath been generally taken for granted (without any more nice
  observation) that the <i>two Æquinoxes</i> are the proper times, to which
  these <i>Annual high Tides</i> are to be referred; And such causes sought
  for, as might best sute with such a Supposition.</p>

  <p>But it is now, the best part of twenty years, since I have had
  frequent occasions to converse with some Inhabitants of
  <i>Rumney-marsh</i> in <i>Kent</i>; where the Sea being kept out with
  great Earthen walls, that it do not at high water overflow the Levell;
  <!-- Page 276 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page276"></a>{276}</span>and the Inhabitants livelyhood depending
  most on grazing, or feeding Sheep; they are (as you may believe they have
  reason to be) very vigilant and observant, at what times they are most in
  danger of having their Lands drowned. And I find them generally agreed,
  by their constant Observations, (and Experience dearly bought) that their
  times of danger are about the beginning of <i>February</i> and of
  <i>November</i>; that is, at those Spring Tides which happen near those
  times; to which they give the names of <i>Candlemass-stream</i> and
  <i>Allhallond-stream</i>; And if they scape those Spring-tides, they
  apprehend themselves out of Danger for the rest of the year. And as for
  <i>March</i> and <i>September</i> (the two <i>Æquinoxes</i>) they are as
  little solicitous of them, as of any other part of the year.</p>

  <p>This, I confess, I much wondred at, when I first heard it; and
  suspected it to be but a mistake of him, that first told me, though he
  were indeed a person not likely so to be mistaken, in a thing wherein he
  was so much concerned: But I soon found, that it was not onely his, but a
  general observation of others too; both there, and elsewhere along the
  Sea coast. And though they did not pretend to know any reason of it, (nor
  so much as to enquire after it;) Yet none made doubt of it; but would
  rather laugh at any that should talk of <i>March</i> and
  <i>September</i>, as being the dangerous times. And since that time, I
  have my self very frequently observed (both at <i>London</i> and
  elsewhere, as I have had occasion), that in those months of
  <i>February</i> and <i>November,</i> (especially <i>November</i>), the
  Tides have run much higher, than at other times: Though I confess, I have
  not been so diligent to set down those Observations, as I should have
  done. Yet this I do particularly very well remember, that in
  <i>November</i> 1660. (the same year that his Majesty returned) having
  occasion to go by Coach from the <i>Strand</i> to <i>Westminster</i>, I
  found the Water so high in the middle of <i>King-street</i>, that it came
  up, not onely to the Boots, but into the Body of the Coach; and the
  <i>Pallace-yard</i> (all save a little place near the <i>West-End</i>)
  overflow'd; as likewise the Market-place; and many other places; and
  their Cellars generally filled up with Water. And in <i>November</i>
  last, 1665. it may yet be very well remembred, what very high Tides there
  were, not onely on the Coasts of <i>England</i>, (where much hurt was
  <!-- Page 277 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page277"></a>{277}</span>done by it) but much more, in
  <i>Holland</i>, where by reason of those Inundations, many Villages and
  Towns were overflow'd. And though I cannot so particularly name other
  years, yet I can very safely say, that I very often observed Tides
  strangely high about those times of the year.</p>

  <p>This Observation did for divers years cause me much to wonder, not
  only because it is so contrary to the received opinion of the two
  <i>Æquinoxes</i>; but because I could not think of any thing signal at
  those times of the year: as being neither the two <i>Æquinoxes</i>, nor
  the two <i>Solstices</i>, nor the Sun's <i>Apogæum</i> and
  <i>Perigæum</i>: (or Earths <i>Aphelium</i> and <i>Perihelium</i>;) nor
  indeed, at contrary times of the year, which at least, would seem to be
  expected. From <i>Alhollandtide</i> to <i>Candlemass</i> being but three
  months; and from thence to <i>Alhollandtide</i> again nine months.</p>

  <p>At length it came into my mind, about four years since, that though
  there do not about these times happen any <i>single</i> signal Accident,
  which might cast it on these times, yet there is a <i>compound of two</i>
  that may do it; Which is the <i>Inequality</i> of the <i>Natural day</i>
  (I mean that of 24. hours, from noon to noon) arising at least from a
  double cause; either of which singly would cast it upon other times, but
  both joyntly on those.</p>

  <p>It's commonly thought, how unequal soever the length be of the
  <i>Artificial</i> dayes as contradistinguished to nights, yet that the
  <i>Natural</i> <span class="correction" title="Original reads `Day', corrected by errata, page 310."
  >Days</span>, reckoning from noon to noon, are all <i>equal</i>: But
  <i>Astronomers</i> know well, that even these dayes are
  <i>unequal</i>.</p>

  <p>For, this <i>Natural</i> Day is measured <i>not onely</i> by one
  intire conversion of the <i>Æquinoctial</i>, or 24. <i>Æquinoctial</i>
  hours, (which is indeed taken to be performed in equal times,) <i>but</i>
  increases by so much, as answers to that part of the <i>Sun's</i> (or
  <i>Earths</i>,) Annual motion as is performed in that time. For, when
  that part of the <i>Æquinoctial</i>, which (with the <i>Sun</i>) was the
  <i>Meridian</i> yesterday at noon, is come thither again to day, it is
  not yet <i>Noon</i> (because the Sun is not now at the place where
  yesterday he was, but is gone forward about one degree, more or less) but
  we must stay till that place, where the <i>Sun</i> now is, comes to the
  <i>Meridian</i> before it be now <i>Noon</i>.</p>

  <p>Now this Additament (above the 24 <i>Æquinoctial</i> hours, or intire
  conversion of the <i>Æquinoctial</i>) is upon a double account <!-- Page
  278 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page278"></a>{278}</span>unequal.
  <i>First</i>, because the Sun, by reason of its <i>Apogæum</i> and
  <i>Perigæum</i>, doth not at all times of the year dispatch in one day an
  equal Arch of the <i>Ecliptick</i>; but greater Arches neer the
  <i>Perigæum</i>, which is about the middle of <i>December</i>; and lesser
  neer the <i>Apogæum</i>, which is about the middle of <i>June</i>: As
  will appear sufficiently by the <i>Tables</i> of the Sun's Annual motion.
  <i>Secondly</i>, though the Sun should in the <i>Ecliptick</i> move
  alwaies at the same rate; yet equal Arches of the <i>Ecliptick</i> do not
  in all parts of the <i>Zodiack</i> answer to equal Arches of the
  <i>Æquinoctial</i>, by which we are to estimate time: Because some parts
  of it, as about the two <i>Solsticial</i> Points, lie nearer to a
  <i>parallel</i> position to the <i>Æquinoctial</i>, than others, as those
  about the two <i>Æquinoctial</i> points, where the <i>Ecliptick</i> and
  <i>Æquinoctial</i> do intersect; whereupon an Arch of the
  <i>Ecliptick</i>, neer the <i>Solsticial</i> points answers to a greater
  Arch of the <i>Æquinoctial</i>, than an Arch equal thereunto neer the
  <i>Æquinoctial</i> points: As doth sufficiently appear by the
  <i>Tables</i> of the Suns <i>right Ascension</i>.</p>

  <p>According to the <i>first</i> of these causes, we should have the
  longest <i>natural</i> daies in <i>December</i>, and the shortest in
  <i>June</i>, which if it did operate alone, would give us at those times
  two <i>Annual</i> High-waters.</p>

  <p>According to the <i>second</i> cause, if operating singly, we should
  have the longest daies at the two Solstices in <i>June</i> and
  <i>December</i>, and the two shortest at the <i>Æquinoxes</i> in
  <i>March</i> and <i>September</i>; which would at those times give
  occasion of four <i>Annual</i> High-waters.</p>

  <p>But the true <i>Inequality</i> of the Natural Days, arising from a
  <i>Complication of those two causes</i>, sometimes crossing and sometimes
  promoting each each other: though we should find some increases or
  decreases of the <i>Natural</i> daies at all those seasons answerable to
  the respective causes (and perhaps of Tides proportionably thereunto:)
  yet the longest and shortest <i>natural daies</i> absolutely of the whole
  year (arising from this complication of Causes) are about those times of
  <i>Allhallontide</i> and <i>Candlemas</i>; (or not far from them) about
  which those <i>Annual</i> High-tides are found to be: As will appear by
  the <i>Tables of Æquation</i> of <i>Natural</i> daies. And therefore I
  think, we may with very good reason cast this <i>Annual</i> Period upon
  that cause, or rather <!-- Page 279 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page279"></a>{279}</span>complication of causes. For (as we before
  shewed in the <i>Menstrual</i> and <i>Diurnal</i>) there will, by this
  inequality of Natural daies, arise a <i>Physical</i> Acceleration and
  Retardation of the Earths <i>Mean</i> motion, and accordingly a casting
  of the Waters backward or forward; either of which, will cause an
  Accumulation or High-water.</p>

  <p>'Tis true, that these longest and shortest daies, do (according to the
  <i>Tables</i>, some at least) fall rather before, than after
  <i>Alhallontide</i> and <i>Candlemas</i> (to wit the ends of
  <i>October</i> and <i>January</i>;) but so do also (sometimes) those high
  Tydes: And it is not yet so well agreed amongst <i>Astronomers</i>, what
  are all the Causes (and in what degrees) of the Inequality of Natural
  daies; but that there be diversities among them, about the true time: And
  whether the introducing of this New Motion of the Earth in its
  <i>Epicycle</i> about this Common Center of <i>Gravity</i>, ought not
  therein also to be accounted for, I will not now determine: Having
  already said enough, if not too much, for the explaining of this general
  Hypothesis, leaving the particularities of it to be adjusted according to
  the true measures of the motions; if the General Hypothesis be found fit
  to be admitted.</p>

  <p>Yet this I must add, (that I be not mistaken) that whereas I cast the
  time of the daily Tydes to be at all places, when the Moon is there in
  the <i>Meridian</i>; it must be understood of <i>open</i> Seas, where the
  water hath such free scope for its motions, as if the whole Globe of
  Earth were equally covered with water: Well knowing, that in <i>Bayes</i>
  and <i>In land-Channels</i>, the position of the Banks and other like
  causes must needs make the times to be much different from what we
  suppose in the open Seas: And likewise, that even in the Open Seas,
  <i>Islands</i>, and <i>Currents</i>, <i>Gulfs</i> and <i>Shallows</i>,
  may have some influence, though not comparable to that of <i>Bays</i> and
  <i>Channels</i>. And moreover, though I think, that Seamen do commonly
  reckon the time of High-water in the <i>Open Seas</i>, to be then, when
  the Moon is there in the <i>Meridian</i> (as this Hypothesis would cast
  it:) Yet I do not take my self to be so well furnished with a <i>History
  of Tides</i>, as to assure my self of it; much less to accommodate it to
  particular places and cases.</p>

  <p>Having thus dispatched the main of what I had to say <!-- Page 280
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page280"></a>{280}</span>concerning the
  Seas Ebbing and Flowing: Had I not been already too tedious, I should now
  proceed to give a further reason, why I do introduce this consideration
  of the <i>Common Center of Gravity</i> in reference to <i>Astronomical
  Accounts</i>. For indeed, that which may possibly seem at first to be an
  Objection <i>against</i> it, is with me one reason <i>for</i> it.</p>

  <p>It may be thought perhaps, that if the Earth should thus describe an
  <i>Epicycle</i> about the Common Center of Gravity, it would (by this its
  change of place) disturbe the <i>Cælestial</i> motions; and make the
  <i>apparent</i> places of the Planets, especially some of them, different
  from what they would otherwise be. For though so small a removal of the
  Earth, as the <i>Epicycle</i> would cause (especially if its
  <i>Semidiameter</i> should not be above 1&#x2153; of the Earths
  Semidiameter) would scarce be sensible (if at all) to the remoter
  Planets; yet as to the nearer it might.</p>

  <p>Now though what <i>Galilæo</i> answers to a like Objection in his
  <i>Hypothesis</i>; (that its possible there may be some small difference,
  which <i>Astronomers</i> have not yet been so accurate, as to observe)
  might here perhaps serve the turn; Yet my answer is much otherwise; to
  wit, that such difference hath been observed and hath very much puzzeled
  <i>Astronomers</i> to give an account of. About which you will find Mr.
  <i>Horrocks</i> (in some of his Letters, whereof I did formerly, upon the
  Command of the <i>Royal Society</i>, make an <i>Extract</i>) was very
  much perplexed; and was fain, for want of other relief, to have recourse
  to somewhat like <i>Keplers</i> amicable <i>Fibres</i>, which did
  according to the several positions of the Moon, accelerate or retard the
  Moon's motion; which <i>amicable Fibres</i> he had no affection to at all
  (as there appears) if he could any other waies give account of those
  little inequalities; and would much rather (I doubt not) have embraced
  this Notion of the Common Center of Gravity, to salve the
  <i>Phænomenon</i>, had it come to his mind, or been suggested to him. And
  you find, that other <i>Astronomers</i> have been seen to bring in (some
  upon one supposition, some upon another) some kind of <i>Menstrual
  Æquation</i>, to solve the inequalities of the Moon's motion, according
  to her <i>Synodical</i> Revolution, or different Aspects (of New-moon,
  Full Moon, &amp;c.) beside what concerns her own <i>Periodical</i>
  motion. <!-- Page 281 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page281"></a>{281}</span></p>

  <p>For which, this consideration of the <i>Common Center of Gravity of
  the Earth and Moon</i>, is so proper a remedy (especially if it shall be
  found precisely to answer those <i>Phænomena</i>, which I have not
  Examined, but am very apt to believe) that it is so far from being, with
  me, an Objection against it, that it is one of the reasons, which make me
  inclinable to introduce it.</p>

  <p>I must before I leave this, add one Consideration more, That if we
  shall upon these Considerations think it reasonable, thus to consider the
  <i>Common Center of Gravity of the Earth and Moon</i>; it may as well be
  thought reasonable, that the like Consideration should be had of
  <i>Jupiter</i> and his four <i>Satellites</i>, which according to the
  Complication of their several motions, will somewhat change the position
  of <i>Jupiter</i>, as to that <i>Common center of Gravity</i> of all
  these Bodies; which yet, because of their smallness, may chance to be so
  little, as that, at this distance, the change of <span class="correction"
  title="Original reads `this', corrected by errata, page 310.">his</span>
  apparent place may not be discernable. And what is said of
  <i>Jupiter</i>, is in the like manner to be understood of <i>Saturne</i>
  and his <i>Satelles</i>, discovered by <i>Hugenius</i>: For all these
  <i>Satellites</i> are to their <i>Principals</i>, as so many Moons to the
  Earth. And I do very well remember, in the Letters forecited, Mr.
  <i>Horrocks</i> expresseth some such little inequalities in
  <i>Saturnes</i> motion, of which he could not imagine what account to
  give, as if (to use his Expression) this crabbed <i>Old Saturn</i> had
  despised his <i>Youth</i>. Which, for ought I know, might well enough
  have been accounted for, if at that time the <i>Satelles</i> of
  <i>Saturn</i> had been discovered, and that Mr. <i>Horrocks</i> had
  thought of such a <span class="correction" title="Original reads `motion', corrected by errata, page 310."
  >notion</span> as the <i>Common Center of Gravity</i> of <i>Saturn</i>
  and his <i>Companion</i>, to be considerable, as to the guiding of his
  motion.</p>

  <p>You have now, in obedience to your Commands, an Account of my
  thoughts, as to this matter, though yet immature and unpolished: What use
  you will please to make of them, I shall leave to your prudence,
  &amp;c.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<h3><i>An </i>APPENDIX<i>, written by way of Letter to the </i>Publisher<i>;
Being an answer to some Objections, made by several Persons, to
the precedent Discourse.</i></h3>

  <p>I Received yours; and am very well contented, that <i>objections</i>
  be made against my <i>Hypothesis</i> concerning <i>Tydes</i>: being <!--
  Page 282 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page282"></a>{282}</span>proposed but as a conjecture to be
  examined; and, upon that Examination, rectified, if there be occasion; or
  rejected, if it will not hold water.</p>

  <p>1. To the first objection of those you mention; <i>That it appears not
  how two Bodies, that have no tye, can have one common Center of
  Gravity:</i> that is (for so I understand the intendment of the
  objection) can act or be acted in the same manner, as if they were
  connected: I shall onely answer, that it is harder to shew <i>How</i>
  they have, than <i>That</i> they have it. That the Load-stone and Iron
  have somewhat equivalent to a Tye; though we see it not, yet by the
  effects we know. And it would be easy to shew, that two Load-stones, at
  once applyed, in different positions, to the same Needle, at some
  convenient distance, will draw it, not to point directly to either of
  them, but to some point between both; which point is, as to those two,
  the <i>common Center of Attraction;</i> and it is the same, as if some
  <i>one</i> Load-stone were in that point. Yet have these two Load stones
  no connection or tye, though a <i>Common Center of Virtue</i> according
  to which they joyntly act. And as to the present case, <i>How</i> the
  Earth and Moon are connected; I will not now undertake to shew (nor is it
  necessary to my purpose;) but, That there is somewhat, that doth connect
  them, (as much as what connects the Load-stone, and the Iron, which it
  draws,) is past doubt to those, who allow them to be carryed about by the
  Sun, as one Aggregate or Body, whose parts keep a respective position to
  one another: Like as <i>Jupiter</i> with his <i>four Satellites</i>, and
  <i>Saturn</i> with his <i>one</i>. Some Tye there is, that makes those
  <i>Satellites</i> attend their <i>Lords</i>, and move in a Body; though
  we do not <i>See</i> that Tye; nor <i>Hear</i> the Words of Command. And
  so here.</p>

  <p>2. To the second objection; <i>That, at Chatham and in the Thames, the
  Annual Spring-tydes, happen about the Æquinoxes; not (as this Hypothesis
  doth suppose elsewhere to have been observed) about the beginning of
  February and November.</i> If their meaning be, that Annual High Tydes,
  do then happen, and then onely: If this prove true, it will ease me of
  half my work. For it is then easily answered, that it depends upon the
  <i>Obliquity of the Zodiack</i>; the parts of the Æquinoctial answering
  to equal parts of the <!-- Page 283 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page283"></a>{283}</span><i>Zodiack</i>, being neer the Solstitial
  points greatest, and near the Æquinoctial points least of all. But beside
  this <i>Annual Vicissitude of the Æquinoxes</i>, not to say, of the 4.
  Cardinal Points (which my Hypothesis doth allow and assert;) I believe it
  will be found, that there is <i>another Annual vicissitude</i> answering
  to the Suns <i>Apogæum</i> and <i>Perigæum</i>. And that the greatest
  Tydes of all, will be found to be upon a result of these two causes
  Cooperating: which (as doth the Inequality of Natural dayes, depending on
  these same causes) will light nearer the times, I mention. To what is
  said to be observed at <i>Chatham</i> and in the <i>Thames</i>, contrary
  to that I allege as observed in <i>Rumney marsh</i>: I must at present
  <span title="apechein" class="grk"
  >&#x1F00;&pi;&#x1F73;&chi;&epsilon;&iota;&nu;</span>, and refer to a
  <i>melius inquirendum</i>. If those who object this contrary observation,
  shall, after this notice, find, upon new Observations heedfully taken,
  that the <i>Spring-tydes</i> in <i>February</i> and <i>November</i>, are
  not so high, as those in <i>March</i> and <i>September</i>; I shall then
  think the objection very considerable. But I do very well remember, that
  I have seen in <i>November</i>, very high Tydes at <i>London</i>, as well
  as in <i>Rumney Marsh</i>. And, the time is not yet so far past, but that
  it may be remembered (by your self or others then in <i>London</i>)
  whether in <i>November</i> last when the Tydes were so high at
  <i>Dover</i>, at <i>Deal</i>, at <i>Margate</i>, and all along the Coast
  from thence to <i>Rumney Marsh</i>, as to do in some of those places much
  hurt, (and, in <i>Holland</i>, much more;) whether, I say, there were not
  also at the same time, at <i>London</i>, (upon the <i>Thames</i>) very
  high Tydes. But a good <i>Diary</i> of the Height and time both of
  High-water, and Low-water, for a year or two together, even at
  <i>Chatham</i>, or <i>Greenwich</i>; but rather at some place in the
  <i>open</i> Sea, or at the <i>Lands end</i> in <i>Cornwal</i>, or on the
  <i>West parts of Ireland</i>; or at St. <i>Hellens</i>, or the
  <i>Bermodas</i>, &amp;c. would do more to the resolving of this point,
  than any verbal discourse without it.</p>

  <p>3. To the third Objection, <i>That supposing the Earth and Moon to
  move about a Common center of gravity; if that the highest Tydes be at
  the New-moon, when the moon being nearest to the Sun, the Earth is
  farthest from it, and its compound motion at the swiftest; and that the
  Tydes abate as the Earth approacheth nearer; till it comes into the
  supposed Circle of her Annual motion: It may be demanded, why do they not
  still abate as the Earth comes yet nearer to the Sun; and the</i> <!--
  Page 284 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page284"></a>{284}</span><i>swiftnesse of its compound motion still
  slackens? And so, why have we not Spring tides at the New Moon (when the
  motion is swiftest) and Neap tides at Full Moon (when the motion is
  slowest) but Spring tides at both?</i> The answer (if observed) is
  already given in my <i>Hypothesis</i> it self. Because the effect is
  indifferently to follow, either upon a suddain Acceleration, or a suddain
  Retardation. (Like as a loose thing, lying on a moving body; if the body
  be thrust suddainly forward, that loose thing is cast back, or rather
  left behind, not having yet obtained an equal <i>impetus</i> with that of
  the body, on which it lyes; but if stopped, or notably retarded, that
  loose incumbent is thrown forward, by its formerly contracted
  <i>impetus</i> not yet qualified or accomodated to the slowness of the
  Body, on which it lyes.) Now both of these happening, the one at the New
  Moon, the other at the Full Moon, do cause high Tides at both.</p>

  <p>4. To the fourth Objection, <i>That the highest Tydes are not at all
  places, about the New Moon and Full Moon; and particularly, that, in some
  places of the East Indies, the Highest Tydes are at the Quadratures</i>:
  I must first answer in <i>general</i>; That as to the particular
  varieties of Tydes in several parts of the World, I cannot pretend to
  give a satisfactory account, for want of a competent History of Tydes,
  <i>&amp;c.</i> Because (as is intimated in what I wrote in the
  <i>general</i>) the various positions of Chanels, Bays, Promontories,
  Gulfs, Shallows, Currents, Trade-winds, <i>&amp;c.</i> must needs make an
  innumerable variety of Accidents in particular places, of which no
  satisfactory account is to be given from the general <i>Hypothesis</i>
  (though never so true) without a due consideration of all those. Which is
  a task too great for me to undertake, being so ill furnished with
  materials for it. And then as to the particular instance of some places
  in the <i>East Indies</i>, where the highest Tydes are at the
  <i>Quadratures</i>: I suppose, it may be chiefly intended of those about
  <i>Cambaia</i>, and <i>Pegu</i>. At which places, beside that they are
  situate at the inmost parts of Vast Bayes, or Gulfs (as they are called)
  they have also vast In-draughts of some hundred Miles within Land; which
  when the Tydes are out, do lye (in a manner) quite dry: And may therefore
  very well be supposed to participate the effect of the Menstrual Tydes
  many dayes after the <!-- Page 285 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page285"></a>{285}</span>cause of them happens in the open Sea,
  upon a like ground as in Straights and narrow Channels the Diurnall Tydes
  happen some hours later than in the Ocean. And a like account must be
  given of particular accidents in other places, from the particular
  situation of those places, as <i>Bays</i>, <i>Chanels</i>,
  <i>Currents</i>, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>5. To the 5. Objection, <i>That the Spring-Tydes happen not, with us,
  just at the Full and Change, but two or three daies after</i>. I should
  with the more confidence attempt an Answer, were I certain, whether it be
  so in the <i>Open</i> Seas, or onely in our Channels. For the Answers
  will not be the same in both cases. If onely in our Channels, where the
  Tydes find a large in-draught; but not in the Open Seas: we must seek the
  reason of it from the particular position of these places. But if it be
  so generally in the wide Open Seas: We must then seek a reason of it from
  the general Hypothesis. And, till I know the matter of Fact, I know not
  well, which to offer at; lest whilst I attempt to salve one, I should
  fall foul of the other. I know that Marriners use to speak of
  Spring-Tydes at the New and Full of the Moon; though I have still had a
  suspition that it might be some daies after, as well in the open Seas, as
  in our narrower Channels; (and therefore I have chosen to say, in my
  Papers, <i>About</i> the New and Full, rather than <i>At</i> the New and
  Full; and even when I do say <i>At</i>, I intend it in that laxer sense
  in which I suppose the Marriners are to be understood, for <i>Neer</i>
  that time:) Of which suspition you will find some intimations even in my
  first Papers: But this though I can admit; yet, because I was not sure of
  it, I durst not build upon it. The truth is, the Flux and Reflux of water
  in a vessel, by reason of the jogging of it, though it follow thereupon;
  yet is, for the most part, discernable some time after. For there must,
  upon that jog, be some time for Motion, before the Accumulation can have
  made a Tyde. And so I do not know but that we must allow it in all the
  Periods. For as the <i>menstrual</i> High Tyde, is not (at least with us)
  till some Daies after the Full and Change; so is the <i>Diurnal</i> High
  water, about as many Hours, after the Moons comming to South; (I mean, At
  Sea: for in Chanels it varies to all Hours, according as they are neerer
  or further from the open Sea:) And the <i>Annual</i> High-Tydes of
  <i>November</i> and <i>February</i>; somewhat later than <!-- Page 286
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page286"></a>{286}</span>(what I
  conjecture to be from the same causes) the greatest Inequalities of the
  natural Days, happening in <i>January</i> and <i>October</i>. But this
  though I can admit, yet (till I am sure of the matter of Fact) I do not
  build upon. And since it hath hitherto been the custome to speak with
  that laxness of expression; assigning the times of New-moon, Full-moon,
  and Quadratures, with the Moons comming to South, for, what is neer those
  times: I did not think myself obliged in my conjectural Hypothesis (while
  it is yet but a <i>Candidate</i>) to speak more nicely. If the Hypothesis
  for the maine of it be found Rational; the Niceties of it are to be
  adjusted, in time, from particular Observation.</p>

  <p>Having thus given you some Answers to the Objections you signifie to
  have been made by several persons to my Hypothesis, and that in the same
  order your Paper presents them to me; I shall next give you some account
  of the two <i>Books</i>, which you advised me to consult; so far as seems
  necessary to this business; Which, upon your intimation, I have since
  perused, though before I had not.</p>

  <p>And first, as to that of <i>Isaac Vossius, De motu Marium &amp;
  Ventorum</i>; Though I do not concur with him in his Hypothesis; That all
  the <i>Great motions of the Seas</i>, &amp;c. should arise onely from
  <i>so small a warming of the water</i> as to raise it (where most of all)
  <i>not a Foot</i> in perpendicular, (as in his 12<i>th</i> Chapter.) Or
  that there is no other connexion between the Moons motion, and the Tydes
  <i>menstrual</i> period, than a <i>casual Synchronism</i> (which seems to
  be the doctrine of his 16<i>th</i> and 18<i>th</i> Chapters;) Beside many
  other things in his Philosophy, which I cannot allow: Yet I am well
  enough pleased with what is Historical in it, of the matter of Fact:
  Especially if I may be secure, that he is therein accurate and candid,
  not wresting the <i>Phænomena</i> to his own purpose. But I find nothing
  in it, which doth induce me to vary from my Hypothesis. For, granting his
  Historicals to be all true; the account of the constant Current of the
  Sea Westward, and of the constant Eastern Blasts, &amp;c. within the
  <i>Tropicks</i>, is much more plausibly, and (I suppose) truly rendered
  by <i>Galilæo</i> long since, from the Earths <i>Diurnal</i> motion:
  (which, neare the <i>Æquator</i>, describing a greater Circle, than
  nearer the <!-- Page 287 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page287"></a>{287}</span><i>Poles</i>, makes the Current to be
  there more conspicuous and swift, and consequently, the Eddy, or
  recurrent motion, nearer the Poles, where this is, more remiss:) than can
  easily be rendered by so small a Tumor, as he supposeth. Not to adde;
  that his account of the Progressive motion, which he fansieth to follow
  upon this Tumefaction, and by Acceleration to grow to so great a height
  near the Shoar (as in Chap. 13. and 14.) is a Notion, which seems to me
  too extravagant to be salved by any laws of <i>Staticks</i>. And that of
  the Moons motion onely Synchronizing with the Tydes, casually, without
  any <i>Physical</i> connexion; I can very hardly assent to. For it can
  hardly be imagined, that any such constant <i>Synchronisme</i> should be
  in Nature; but where, either the one is the cause of the other, or both
  depend upon some <i>Common</i> cause. And where we see so fair a
  foundation for a <i>Physical</i> connection. I am not prone to ascribe it
  to an Independent Sychronism. In sum; His History doth well enough agree
  with my Hypothesis; and I think, the Phænomena are much better salved by
  mine, than his.</p>

  <p>And then as to <i>Gassendus</i>, in his discourse <i>De Æstu
  Maris</i>; I find him, after the relating of many other Opinions
  concerning the Cause of it, inclining to that of <i>Galilæo</i>,
  ascribing it to the Acceleration &amp; Retardation of the Earths motion,
  compounded of the Annual and Diurnal; And moreover attempting to give an
  account of the <i>Menstrual Periods</i> from the Earths carrying the Moon
  about it self, as <i>Jupiter</i> doth his <i>Satellites</i>; which
  together with them is carryed about by the <i>Sun</i>, as one Aggregate;
  (and that the Earth with its Moon is to be supposed in like manner to be
  carried about by the Sun, as one Aggregate, cannot be reasonably doubted,
  by those who entertain the <i>Copernican Hypothesis</i>, and do allow the
  same of <i>Jupiter</i> and his <i>Satellites</i>.) But though he would
  thus have the Earth and Moon looked upon as two parts of the same moved
  Aggregate, yet he doth still suppose (as <i>Galilæo</i> had done before
  him) that the line of the Mean Motion of this Aggregate (or, as he calls,
  <i>motus æquabilis et veluti medius</i>) is described by the
  <i>Center</i> of the <i>Earth</i> (about which Center he supposeth both
  its own revolution to be made, and an Epicycle described by the Moons
  motion;) not by another Point, distinct from the Centers of both, about
  which, as the <!-- Page 288 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page288"></a>{288}</span>common Center of Gravity, as well that of
  the Earth, as that of the Moon, are to describe several Epicycles. And,
  for that Reason fails of giving any clear account of this
  <i>Menstrual</i> Period. (And in like manner, he proposeth the
  Consideration as well of the Earths <i>Aphelium</i> and <i>Perihelium</i>
  as of the <i>Æquinoctial</i> and <i>Solstitial</i> Points, in order to
  the finding a Reason of the <i>Annual</i> Vicissitudes; but doth not fix
  upon any thing, in which himself can Acquiesce: And therefore leaves it
  <i>in medio</i> as he found it.)</p>

  <p>It had been more agreeable to the Laws of <i>Staticks</i>, if he had,
  (as I do,) so considered the <i>Earth</i> and <i>Moon</i> as two parts of
  the same movable, (not so, as he doth, <i>aliam in Centro et sequentem
  præcise revolutionem axis, aliam remotius ac velut in circumferentia</i>,
  but,) so, as to make neither of them the Center, but both out of it,
  describing Epicycles about it: Like as, when a long stick thrown in the
  Air, whose one end is heavyer than the other, is whirled about, so as
  that the End, which did first fly foremost, becomes hindmost; the proper
  line of motion of this whole Body is not that, which is described by
  either End, but that, which is described by a middle point between them;
  about which point each end, in whirling, describes an Epicycle. And
  indeed, in the present case, it is not the Epicycle described by the
  Moon, but that, described by the Earth, which gives the <i>Menstrual</i>
  Vicissitudes of motion to the Water; which would, as to this, be the
  same, if the Earth so move, whether there were any Moon to move or not;
  nor would the Moons Motion, supposing the Earth to hold on its own
  course, any whit concern the motion of the Water.</p>

      <a href="images/VI_N16_Fig5.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/VI_N16_Fig5.png"
      alt="Fig. 5." title="Fig. 5." /></a>
  </div>
  <p>But now, (after all our Physical, or Statical Considerations) the
  clearest Evidence for this Hypothesis (if it can be had) will be from
  Celestial Observations. As for instance; (see <i>Fig.</i> 5.) Supposing
  the Sun at S; the Earths place in its Annual Orb at T; and <i>Mars</i>
  (in opposition to the Sun, or near it) at M: From whence <i>Mars</i>
  should appear in the Zodiack at <span class="grk">&gamma;</span>, and
  will at Full moon be seen there to be; the Moon being at C and the Earth
  at c; (and the like at the New-moon.) But if the Moon be in the First
  quarter at A, and the Earth at a: <i>Mars</i> will be seen, not at <span
  class="grk">&gamma;</span>, but at <span class="grk">&alpha;</span>; too
  slow: And when the Moon is at B, and the Earth at b, <i>Mars</i> will be
  seen at <span class="grk">&beta;</span>; yet too slow: till at the <!--
  Page 289 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page289"></a>{289}</span>Full-moon, the Moon at C, the Earth at c,
  <i>Mars</i> will be seen at <span class="grk">&gamma;</span>, its true
  place, as if the Earth were at T. But then, after the Full, the Moon at
  D, the Earth at d; <i>Mars</i> will be seen, not at <span
  class="grk">&gamma;</span>, but at <span class="grk">&delta;</span>, too
  forward: and yet more, when the Moon (at the last Quarter) is at E, the
  Earth at e, and <i>Mars</i> seen at <span class="grk">&epsilon;</span>.
  If therefore <i>Mars</i> (when in opposition to the Sun) be found (all
  other allowances being made) somewhat too backward before the Full moon,
  and somewhat too forward after the Full-moon, (and most of all, at the
  Quadratures:) it will be the best confirmation of the Hypothesis. (The
  like may be fitted to <i>Mars</i> in other positions, <i>mutatis
  mutandis</i>; and so for the other Planets.)</p>

  <p>But this proof, is of like nature as that of the Parallaxis of the
  Earths Annual Orb to prove the Copernican Hypothesis. If it can be
  observed, it proves the Affirmative; but if it cannot be observed, it
  doth not convince the Negative, but only proves that the Semidiameter of
  the Earths Epicycle is so small as not to make any discernable Parallax.
  And indeed, I doubt, that will be the issue. For the Semidiameter of this
  Epicycle, being little more than the Semidiameter of the Earth it self,
  or about 1&#x2153; thereof (as is conjectured, in the <i>Hypothesis</i>,
  from the Magnitudes and Distances of the Earth and Moon compared;) and
  there having not as yet been observed any discernable <i>Parallax</i> of
  <i>Mars</i>, even in his neerest position to the Earth; it is very
  suspicious, that here it may prove so too. And whether any of the other
  Planets will be more favourable in this point, I cannot say.</p>

<h3><i>ANIMADVERSIONS
of Dr. </i>Wallis<i>, upon Mr. </i>Hobs<i>'s late Book, </i>De Principiis &amp;
Ratiocinatione Geometrarum<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>These were communicated by way of Letter, written in <i>Oxford</i>,
  July 24. 1666. to an Acquaintance of the <i>Author</i>, as follows:</p>

  <p>Since I saw you last, I have read over Mr. <i>Hobs</i>'s Book
  <i>Contra Geometras</i> (or <i>De Principiis &amp; Ratiocinatione
  Geometrarum</i>) which you then shewed me. A New Book of <i>Old</i>
  matter: Containing but a <i>Repetition</i> of what he had before told us,
  more than once; and which hath been Answered long agoe.</p>

  <p>In which, though there be Faults enough to offer ample <!-- Page 290
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page290"></a>{290}</span>matter for a
  large Confutation; yet I am scarce inclined to believe, that any will
  bestow so much pains upon it. For, if that be true, which (in his
  <i>Preface</i>) he saith of himself, <i>Aut solus insanio Ego, aut solus
  non insanio</i>: it would either be <i>Needless</i>, or <i>to no
  Purpose</i>. For, by his own confession, <i>All others</i>, if they be
  not mad themselves, ought to think <i>Him</i> so: And therefore, as to
  <i>Them</i> a Confutation would be <i>needless</i>; who, its like, are
  well enough satisfied already: at least out of danger of being seduced.
  And, as to himself, it would be <i>to no purpose</i>. For, if <i>He</i>
  be the Mad man, it is not to be hoped that he will be convinced by
  Reason: Or, if <i>All We</i> be so; we are in no capacity to attempt
  it.</p>

  <p>But there is yet another Reason, why I think it not to need a
  Confutation. Because what is in it, hath been sufficiently confuted
  already; (and, so Effectually; as that he professeth himself not to Hope,
  that <i>This Age</i> is like to give sentence for him; what ever
  <i>Nondum imbuta Posteritas</i> may do.) Nor doth there appear any
  Reason, why he should again Repeat it, unless he can hope, That, what was
  at first False, may by oft Repeating, become True.</p>

  <p>I shall therefore, instead of a large Answer, onely give you a brief
  Account, <i>what is in it</i>; &amp;, <i>where it hath been already
  Answered</i>.</p>

  <p>The chief of what he hath to say, in his first 10 Chapters, against
  <i>Euclids</i> Definitions, amounts but to this, That he thinks,
  <i>Euclide</i> ought to have allowed his <i>Point</i> some
  <i>Bigness</i>; his <i>Line</i>, some <i>Breadth</i>; and his
  <i>Surface</i>, some <i>Thickness</i>.</p>

  <p>But where in his <i>Dialogues</i>, pag. 151, 152. he solemnly
  undertakes to Demonstrate it; (for it is there, his 41th
  <i>Proposition</i>:) his Demonstration amounts to no more but this; That,
  <i>unless a Line be allowed some Latitude; it is not possible that his
  Quadratures can be True</i>. For finding himself reduced to these
  inconveniences; 1. That his <i>Geometrical Constructions</i>, would not
  consist with <i>Arithmetical calculations</i>, nor with what
  <i>Archimedes</i> and others have long since demonstrated: 2. That the
  <i>Arch</i> of a Circle must be allowed to be sometimes <i>Shorter</i>
  than its <i>Chord</i>, and sometimes <i>longer</i> than its
  <i>Tangent</i>: 3. That the same Straight Line must be allowed, at one
  place onely to <i>Touch</i>, and at another place to <i>Cut</i> the same
  Circle: (with others of like nature;) He findes it necessary, that these
  things may not seem Absurd, to allow his <i>Lines</i> some
  <i>Breadth</i>, (that so, as he speaks, <i>While a Straight Line with its
  Out-side doth at one place <!-- Page 291 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page291"></a>{291}</span>Touch the Circle, it may with its In-side
  at another place Cut it</i>, &amp;c.) But I shou'd sooner take this to be
  a <i>Confutation of His Quadratures</i>, than a <i>demonstration of the
  Breadth of a </i>(Mathematical)<i> Line</i>. Of which, see my <i>Hobbius
  Heauton-timorumenus</i>, from <i>pag.</i> 114. to <i>p.</i> 119.</p>

  <p>And what he now Adds, being to this purpose; That though
  <i>Euclid</i>'s <span title="Sêmeion" class="grk"
  >&Sigma;&eta;&mu;&epsilon;&#x1FD6;&omicron;&nu;</span>, which we
  translate, <i>a Point</i>, be not indeed <i>Nomen Quanti</i>; yet cannot
  this be actually represented by any thing, but what will have some
  Magnitude; nor can <i>a Painter</i>, no not <i>Apelles</i> himself, draw
  a <i>Line</i> so small, but that it will have some Breadth; nor can
  <i>Thread</i> be spun so Fine, but that it will have some Bigness;
  (<i>pag.</i> 2, 3, 19, 21.) is nothing to the Business; For
  <i>Euclide</i> doth not speak either of such <i>Points</i>, or of such
  <i>Lines</i>.</p>

  <p>He should rather have considered of his own Expedient, <i>pag.</i> 11.
  That, when one of his (<i>broad</i>) Lines, passing through one of his
  (<i>great</i>) Points, is supposed to cut another Line proposed, into two
  equal parts; we are to understand, the <i>Middle of the breadth</i> of
  that Line, passing through the <i>middle</i> of that Point, to
  distinguish the Line given into two equal parts. And he should then have
  considered further, that <i>Euclide</i>, by a <i>Line</i>, means no more
  than what Mr. <i>Hobs</i> would call <i>the middle of the breadth</i> of
  his; and <i>Euclide</i>'s <i>Point</i>, is but the <i>Middle</i> of Mr.
  <i>Hobs</i>'s. And then, for the same reason, that Mr. <i>Hobs</i>'s
  <i>Middle</i> must be said to have no <i>Magnitude</i>; (For else, not
  the <i>whole Middle</i>, but the <i>Middle of the Middle</i>, will be
  <i>in the Middle</i>: And, the <i>Whole</i> will not be equal to its
  <i>Two Halves</i>; but Bigger than <i>Both</i>, by so much as the
  <i>Middle</i> comes to:) <i>Euclide</i>'s <i>Lines</i> must as well be
  said to have no Breadth; and his <i>Points</i> no Bigness.</p>

  <p>In like manner, When <i>Euclide</i> and others do make the
  <i>Terme</i> or <i>End</i> of a Line, a <i>Point</i>: If this
  <i>Point</i> have <i>Parts</i> or <i>Greatness</i>, then not the
  <i>Point</i>, but the <i>Outer-Half</i> of this Point ends the Line,
  (for, that the <i>Inner-Half</i> of that Point is not at the End, is
  manifest, because the <i>Outer-Half</i> is beyond it:) And again, if that
  <i>Outer Half</i> have <i>Parts</i> also; not this, but the <i>Outer</i>
  part of it, and again the <i>Outer part</i> of that <i>Outer part</i>,
  (and so in <i>infinitum</i>.) So that, as long as <i>Any thing of
  Line</i> remains, we are not yet at the <i>End</i>: And consequently, if
  we must have passed the <i>whole Length</i>, before we be at the
  <i>End</i>; then that <i>End</i> (or <i>Punctum terminans</i>) has
  <i>nothing of Length</i>; (for, when the <i>whole Length</i> is past,
  there is nothing of it left.) And if Mr. <i>Hobs</i> tells us (as
  <i>pag.</i> 3.) that this <!-- Page 292 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page292"></a>{292}</span><i>End</i> is not <i>Punctum</i>, but only
  <i>Signum</i> (which he does allow <i>non esse nomen Quanti</i>) even
  <i>this</i> will serve our turn well enough. <i>Euclid</i>'s <span
  title="Sêmeion" class="grk"
  >&Sigma;&eta;&mu;&epsilon;&#x1FD6;&omicron;&nu;</span>, which some
  Interpreters render by <i>Signum</i>, others have thought fit (with
  <i>Tully</i>) to call <i>Punctum</i>: But if Mr. <i>Hobs</i> like not
  that name, we will not contend about it. Let it be <i>Punctum</i>, or let
  it be <i>Signum</i> (or, if he please, he may call it <i>Vexillum</i>.)
  But then he is to remember, that this is only a Controversie in
  <i>Grammar</i>, not in <i>Mathematicks</i>: And his Book should have been
  intitled <i>Contra Grammaticos</i>, not, <i>Contra Geometras</i>. Nor is
  it <i>Euclide</i>, but <i>Cicero</i>, that is concern'd, in rendring the
  Greek <span title="Sêmeion" class="grk"
  >&Sigma;&eta;&mu;&epsilon;&#x1FD6;&omicron;&nu;</span> by the Latine
  <i>Punctum</i>, not by Mr. <i>Hobs</i>'s <i>Signum</i>. The Mathematician
  is equally content with either word.</p>

  <p>What he saith here, <i>Chap.</i> 8. &amp; 19. (and in his fifth
  <i>Dial.</i> <i>p.</i> 105. <i>&amp;c.</i>) concerning the <i>Angle of
  Contact</i>; amounts but to thus much, That, by the <i>Angle of
  Contact</i>, he doth not mean either what <i>Euclide</i> calls an
  <i>Angle</i>, or any thing of that kind; (and therefore says nothing to
  the purpose of what was in controversie between <i>Clavius</i> and
  <i>Peletarius</i>, when he says, that <i>An Angle of Contact hath some
  magnitude</i>:) But, that by the <i>Angle of Contact</i>, he understands
  the <i>Crookedness of the Arch</i>; and in saying, the <i>Angle of
  Contact hath some magnitude</i>, his meaning is, that the <i>Arch of a
  Circle hath some crookedness</i>, or, is a <i>crooked line</i>: and that,
  of equal Arches, That is the more crooked, whose chord is shortest: which
  I think none will deny; (for who ever doubted, but that a <i>circular
  Arch is crooked</i>? or, that, of such Arches, equal in length, <i>That
  is the more crooked, whose ends by bowing are brought nearest
  together</i>?) But, why the <i>Crookedness of an Arch</i>, should be
  called an <i>Angle of Contact</i>, I know no other reason, but, because
  Mr. <i>Hobs</i> loves to call that <i>Chalk</i>, which others call
  <i>Cheese</i>. Of this see my <i>Hobbius Heauton-timorumenus</i>, from
  <i>pag.</i> 88. to <i>p.</i> 100.</p>

  <p>What he saith here of <i>Rations</i> or <i>Proportions</i>, and their
  <i>Calculus</i>; for 8. Chapters together, (<i>Chap.</i> 11.
  <i>&amp;c,</i>) is but the same for substance, what he had formerly said
  in his 4th. Dialogue, and elsewhere. To which you may see a full Answer,
  in my <i>Hobbius Heauton-tim.</i> from <i>pag.</i> 49. to <i>p.</i> 88.
  which I need not here repeat.</p>

  <p>Onely (as a <i>Specimen</i> of Mr. <i>Hobs</i>'s Candour, in
  Falsifications) you may by the way observe, how he deals a Demonstration
  of Mr. <i>Rook</i>'s, in confutation of Mr. <i>Hobs</i>'s Duplication of
  the Cube. Which when he had repeated, <i>pag.</i> 43. He doth then (that
  it might seem absurd) change those words, <i>æquales <!-- Page 293
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page293"></a>{293}</span>quatuor
  cubis</i> <span class="scac">DV</span>; (<i>pag.</i> 43. <i>line</i> 33.)
  into these (<i>p.</i> 44. <i>l.</i> 5.) <i>æqualia quatuor Lineis, nempe
  quadruplus Recta</i> <span class="scac">DV</span>: And would thence
  perswade you, that Mr. <i>Rook</i> had assigned a <i>Solide</i>, equal to
  a <i>Line</i>. But Mr. <i>Rook's</i> Demonstration was clear enough <span
  class="correction" title="Original reads `for', corrected by errata, page 310."
  >without</span> Mr. <i>Hobse's</i> Comment. Nor do I know any
  Mathematician (unless you take <i>Mr. Hobs</i> to be one) who thinks that
  <i>a Line multiplyed by a Number will make a Square</i>; (what ever
  <i>Mr. Hobs</i> is pleased to teach us.) But, That <i>a Number multiplyed
  by a Number, may make a Square Number</i>; and, That <i>a Line drawn into
  a Line may make a Square Figure</i>, <i>Mr. Hobs</i> (if he were, what he
  would be thought to be) might have known before now. Or, (if he had not
  before known it) he might have learned, (by what I shew him upon a like
  occasion, in my <i>Hob. Heaut.</i> <i>pag.</i> 142. 143. 144.) <i>How</i>
  to understand that language, without an Absurdity.</p>

  <p>Just in the same manner he doth, in the next page, deal with
  <i>Clavius</i>, for having given us his words, pag. 45 l. 3. 4. <i>Dico
  hanc Lineam Perpendicularem extra circulum cadere</i> (because neither
  <i>intra Circulum</i>, nor in <i>Peripherea</i>;) He doth, when he would
  shew an errour, first make one, by falsifying his word, <i>line</i> 15.
  where instead of <i>Lineam Perpendicularem</i>, he substitutes <i>Punctum
  A.</i> As if <i>Euclide</i> or <i>Clavius</i> had denyed the <i>Point
  A.</i> (the utmost point of the <i>Radius</i>,) to be in the
  Circumference: Or, as if Mr. <i>Hobs</i>, by proving the <i>Point A.</i>
  to be in the Circumference, had thereby proved, that the <i>Perpendicular
  Tangent A E</i> had also lyen in the Circumference of the Circle. But
  this is a Trade, which Mr. <i>Hobs</i> doth drive so often, as if he were
  as well faulty in his <i>Morals</i>, as in his <i>Mathematicks</i>.</p>

  <p>The <i>Quadrature of a Circle</i>, which here he gives us,
  <i>Chap.</i> 20. 21. 23. is one of those <i>Twelve</i> of his, which in
  my <i>Hobbius Heauton-timorumenus</i> (from <i>pag.</i> 104. to
  <i>pag.</i> 119) are already confuted: And is the <i>Ninth</i> in order
  (as I there rank them) which is particularly considered, <i>pag.</i> 106.
  107. 108. I call it <i>One</i>, because he takes it so to be; though it
  might as well be called <i>Two</i>. For, as there, so here, it consisteth
  of <i>Two branches</i>, which are Both false; and each overthrow the
  other. For if the <i>Arch of a Quadrant</i> be equal to the <i>Aggregate
  of the Semidiameter and of the Tangent of 30. Degrees</i>, (as he would
  <i>Here</i> have it, in <i>Chap.</i> 20. and <i>There</i>, in the close
  of <i>Prop.</i> 27;) Then is it not equal to <i>that Line, Whose Square
  is equal to Ten squares of the Semiradius</i>, (as, <i>There</i>, he
  would have it, in <i>Prop.</i> 28. and, <i>Here</i>, in <i>Chap. 23.</i>)
  And if it be equal to <i>This</i>, then not to <i>That</i>. For
  <i>This</i>, and <i>That</i>, are not equal: As I then demonstrated; and
  need not now repeat it.</p>

  <p>The grand Fault of his Demonstration (<i>Chap.</i> 20.) wherewith he
  would now New vamp his old false quadrature, lyes in those Words
  <i>Page</i> 49. <i>line</i> 30, 31. <i>Quod Impossibile est nisi
  </i>ba<i> transeat per </i>c<i>.</i> which is no impossibility at all.
  For though he first bid us <i>draw the Line R&nbsp;c</i>, and afterwards the
  <i>Line R&nbsp;d</i>; Yet, Because he hath no where proved (nor is it true)
  that <i>these two are the same Line</i>; (that is, that the point
  <i>d</i> lyes in the <i>Line R&nbsp;c</i>, or that <i>R&nbsp;c</i> passeth through
  <i>d</i>:) His proving that <i>R d cuts off from </i>ab<i> a Line equal
  to the <span class="correction" title="Original reads `Line', corrected by errata, page 310."
  >Sine</span> of R&nbsp;c</i>, doth not prove, that <i>ab</i> passeth through
  <i>c</i>: For this it may well do though <i>ab</i> lye <i>under c.</i>
  (vid. in case <i>d</i> lye beyond the line <i>R&nbsp;c.</i> that is, further
  from <i>A</i>:) And therefore, unless he first prove (which he cannot do)
  that <i>A&nbsp;c</i> ( a sixth part of <i>A&nbsp;D</i>) doth just reach to the line
  <i>R&nbsp;c</i> and no further, he only proves <!-- Page 294 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page294"></a>{294}</span>that a sixth part of
  <i>ab</i> is <i>equal</i> to the <span class="correction" title="Original reads `Line', corrected by errata, page 310."
  >Sine</span> of <i>B&nbsp;c</i>. But, whether it <i>lye above it</i>, or
  <i>below</i> it, or (as Mr. <i>Hobs</i> would have it) just <i>upon</i>
  it; this argument doth not conclude. (And therefore <i>Hugenius's</i>
  assertion, which Mr. <i>Hobs</i>, <i>Chap.</i> 21. would have give way to
  this Demonstration, doth, notwithstanding this, remain safe enough.)</p>

  <p>His demonstration of <i>Chap.</i> 23. (where he would prove, that
  <i>the aggregate of the Radius and of the Tangent of 30. Degrees</i> is
  equal to <i>a Line, whose square is equal to 10 Squares of the
  Semiradius</i>;) is confuted not only by me, (in the place forecited,
  where this is proved to be impossible;) but by himself also, in this same
  Chap. <i>pag.</i> 59. (where he proves sufficiently and doth confesse,
  that this demonstration, and the 47. <i>Prop.</i> of the first of
  <i>Euclide</i>, cannot be both true.) But, (which is worst of all;)
  whether <i>Euclid's</i> Proposition be False or True, his demonstration
  must needs be False. for he is in this Dilemma: If that Proposition be
  <i>True</i>, his demonstration is <i>False</i>, for he grants that they
  cannot be both True, <i>page</i> 59 <i>line</i> 21. 22. And again, if
  that Proposition be False, his Demonstration is so too; for <i>This</i>
  depends upon <i>That</i>, <i>page</i> 55. <i>line</i> 22. and therefore
  must fall with it.</p>

  <p>But the Fault is obvious in <i>His Demonstration</i> (not in
  <i>Euclid's Proposition</i>:) the grand Fault of it (though there are
  more) lyes in those words, <i>page</i> 56. <i>line</i> 26. <i>Erit ergo
  M&nbsp;O minus quam M&nbsp;R</i> Where, instead of <i>minus</i>, he should have
  said <i>majus</i>. And when he hath mended that Error, he will find, that
  the <i>major</i> in <i>page</i> 56. <i>line penult</i>, will very well
  agree with <i>majorem</i> in <i>page</i> 57. <i>line</i> 4 (where the
  <i>Printer</i> hath already mended the Fault to his hand) and then the
  <i>Falsum ergo</i> will vanish.</p>

  <p>His Section of an Angle <i>in ratione data</i>, <i>Chap.</i> 22 hath
  no other foundation, than his supposed <i>Quadrature</i> of <i>Chap.</i>
  20. And therefore, that being false, this must fall with it. It is just
  the same with that of his 6. Dialogue, <i>Prop.</i> 46. which (besides
  that it wants a foundation) how absurd it is, I have already shewed, in
  my <i>Hobbius Heauton-timor.</i> <i>page</i> 119. 120.</p>

  <p>His <i>Appendix</i>, wherein he undertakes to shew a Method of finding
  <i>any number of mean Proportionals, between two Lines given</i>: Depends
  upon the supposed Truth of his 22. Chapter; about <i>Dividing an Arch in
  any proportion given</i>: (As himself professeth: and as is evident by
  the Construction; which supposeth such a Section.) And therefore, that
  failing, this falls with it.</p>

  <p>And yet this is other wise faulty, though <i>that</i> should be
  supposed True. For, In the first Demonstration; <i>page</i> 67.
  <i>line</i> 12. <i>Producta L&nbsp;f incidet in I</i>; is not proved, nor doth
  it follow from his <i>Quoniam igitur</i>.</p>

  <p>In the second Demonstration; <i>page</i> 68. <i>line</i> 34. 35.

  <p>Its <i>Duration</i> hence appears to have been one hour and 54 m. Its
  <i>greatest Obscurity</i> somewhat more than 7. digits. About the middle,
  between the Perpendicular and Westward Horizontal <i>Radius</i> the Sun,
  viewing it through Mr. <i>Boyle</i>'s 60. foot-<i>Telescope</i>, there
  was perceived a little of the Limb of the Moon without the Diske of the
  Sun: which seemed to some of the Observers to come from some shining
  <i>Atmosphere</i> about the Body either of the Sun or Moon.</p>

  <p>They affirm to have observ'd the <i>Figure</i> of this <i>Eclipse</i>,
  and measured the <!-- Page 296 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page296"></a>{296}</span><i>Digits</i>, by casting the
  <i>Figure</i> through a 5 foot <i>Telescope</i>, on an extended paper,
  fix't at a certain distance from the Eye-glasse, and having a round
  figure; all whose <i>Diameters</i> were divided, by 6 <i>Concentrick</i>
  Circles, into 12 <i>Digits</i>.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>The Observations made at <i>Madrid</i> by a Noble Member of the
  <i>Royal Society</i>, His Excellence the Earle of <i>Sandwich</i>, as
  they were sent to the Right Honourable, the Lord Vice-Count
  <i>Brounker</i>, are these;</p>

  <p>The Eclipse <i>began</i> at <i>Madrid</i> about 5 of the Clock in the
  morning, at 5 h. 15&prime;, the Suns <i>Altitude</i> was 6 deg.
  55&prime;.</p>

  <p>The <i>Middle</i> of it was at 6 h. 2&prime;, the Suns
  <i>Altitude</i>, 15. deg. 5&prime;.</p>

  <p>The <i>End</i> was exactly at 7 h. 5&prime;; the Suns <i>Altitude</i>,
  25. deg. 24&prime;.</p>

  <p>The <i>Duration</i>, 2h. 4&prime;.</p>

  <p>37. Parts of the Suns diameter remained light.</p>

  <p>63. Parts of the same were darkened.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>The Observations made at <i>Paris</i> by Monsieur <i>Payen</i>,
  assisted by several <i>Astronomers</i>, as they were printed in
  <i>French</i>, and addressed to Monsieur de <i>Montmor</i>, are
  these;</p>

  <p>The <i>Eclipse</i> began there, at 5 h. 44&prime;. 52&Prime;.
  <i>mane</i>. It ended at 7 h. 43&prime;. 6&Prime;. So that its <i>whole
  Duration</i> was 1 h. 58&prime;. 14&Prime;. The <i>greatest
  Obscuration</i> they assign to have been 7. dig. 50. m. but they adde,
  that it seem'd to have been greater by 3 minuts; which M. <i>Payen</i>
  imputes to a particular motion of <i>libration</i> of the Suns Globe,
  which entertain'd that Luminary in the same <i>Phasis</i> for the space
  of 8. <i>min.</i> and some <i>seconds</i>, as if it had been stopped in
  the midst of its Course; rather than to a tremulous Motion of the
  <i>Atmosphere</i>, as <i>Scheiner</i> would have it.</p>

  <p>They intimate that they took the time of each <i>Phasis</i> from half
  <i>digit</i> to half <i>digit</i>, as well by a <i>Pendulum</i>, as by
  the <i>Altitudes</i> of the <i>Suns Center</i> above the <i>Horizon</i>,
  corrected by the <i>Verticall Paralaxes</i> and <i>Æstivall
  Refractions</i>, by which they judged, that though the Time by the
  <i>Pendulum</i> may be sufficient for <i>Mechanicall</i> Operations, yet
  'tis not exact enough for establishing the <i>Grounds of true
  Astronomy</i>.</p>

  <p>They further conceive that the apparent <i>Diameters</i> were almost
  equal; seeing that in the <i>Phasis</i> of 6. <i>Digits</i>, the
  <i>Circumference</i> of the <i>Moons disk</i> passed through the
  <i>Center</i> of that of the <i>Sun</i>, so as that two Lines drawn
  through the two <i>Horns</i> of the Sun, made with the <i>Common
  Semi-diameter</i> two <i>Equilateral Triangles</i>.</p>

  <p>Next, they affirm, That there was so great a Variation in the
  <i>Parallaxes</i>, by reason as well of the Refractions of the Air, which
  environs the Earth, as of the Alteration of the Air, which encompasses
  the Moon, that the <i>Horns</i> of the Sun, there formed by the Shaddow
  of the Moon, appeared in all kinds of <i>Figures</i>; Sometimes inclined
  to the <i>Vertical</i>, sometimes <i>Perpendicular</i> to the
  <i>Horizon</i>, and at last <i>Parallel</i>; the <i>Convexe</i> part
  respecting the <i>Heaven</i>, and the <i>Concave</i>, the <i>Horizon</i>.
  By the crossing (<i>so they go on</i>) of the <!-- Page 297 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page297"></a>{297}</span><i>Horns</i> with the
  <i>Angles of Inclination</i>, it will be easie to those, that have
  exactly observed them, and that are skill'd in the higher
  <i>Astronomical</i> Calculations, to compute the <i>true Place</i> of the
  <i>Moon</i> in her <i>Orbite</i>, that so it may be compared with that of
  the <i>Tables</i>, and with that, which has been observ'd in other
  places, for the more precise determinating of the <i>Difference</i> of
  <i>Meridians</i> (that being the way, esteem'd by <i>Kepler</i> the most
  certain) and for making a good Judgment of the defect or exactnesse of
  the Celestial <i>Tables</i>.</p>

  <p>Then they observe, That the <i>Beginning</i> and the <i>Middle</i> of
  this <i>Eclipse</i> hapned to be in the <i>North Eastern Hemisphere</i>,
  and the <i>End</i>, in the <i>South-Eastern</i>. The <i>first Contact</i>
  (as 'twere) of the two Disks was observ'd in the <i>Superior Limb</i> of
  the <i>Suns Disk</i> in respect to the <i>Vertical Line</i>, and in the
  <i>Inferior</i> in respect to the <i>Ecliptick</i>: But the
  <i>Middle</i>, and the <i>End</i> were seen in the <i>Superior Limb</i>,
  in respect both to the <i>Vertical</i> and the <i>Ecliptick</i>: And
  (what to this Author seems extraordinary) both the <i>Beginning</i> and
  the <i>End</i> of this <i>Eclipse</i> hapned to be in the <i>Oriental</i>
  part of the Suns Disk.</p>

  <p>Lastly, they take notice, that by their Observations it appears, that
  there is but little exactness in all the <i>Astronomical Tables</i>,
  predicting the <i>Quantity</i>, <i>Beginning</i> and <i>Duration</i> of
  this Eclipse; Those of <i>Lansbergius</i> importing, That the Obscuration
  should be of 10. dig. 48&prime;; those of <i>Ricciolo</i>, of 9. dig.
  1&prime;; and those of <i>Kepler</i>, of 7. dig. 30&prime;. 16&Prime;:
  Again, that the <i>Duration</i> should be of 2h. 2&prime;. Lastly, The
  <i>Beginning</i> did anticipate the <i>Ricciolan Tables</i> by 5
  <i>minuts</i>, the <i>End</i> by 23; and the <i>Middle</i>, almost by 11.
  In the mean time the Author notes, that the <i>Rudolphin Tables</i> come
  nearest to the Truth; and withal assures the <i>Reader</i> of the
  goodnesse of the <i>Instruments</i> employed in his <i>Observations</i>,
  and of the singular care, he, together with his skilful Assistants, took
  in making them.</p>

<h3><i>Some Inquiries and Directions concerning </i>Tides<i>, proposed by Dr.
</i>Wallis<i>, for the proving, or disproving of his lately publish't
</i>Discourse<i> concerning them</i>.</h3>

  <p>The Inquisitive Dr. <i>Wallis</i>, having in his lately printed
  <i>Hypothesis</i> of Tides intimated, that he had reason to believe, that
  the <i>Annual Spring-tides</i> happen to be rather about the beginnings
  of <i>Febr.</i> and <i>Nov.</i> than the two <i>Æquinoxes</i>, doth in a
  late Letter to the <i>Publisher</i>, written from <i>Oxford</i> in
  <i>Aug.</i> last, desire, <span class="correction" title="Original reads `Sea,' (transposed with next line)."
  >that</span> some understanding Persons at <i>London</i>, or
  <i>Greenwich</i>, but rather nearer the <span class="correction"
  title="Original reads `that' (transposed with previous line)."
  >Sea,</span> or upon the Sea-shore, would make <i>particular</i>
  Observation of all the <i>Spring-Tides</i> (<i>New-Moon</i> and
  <i>Full-Moon</i>) between this and the End of <i>November</i>; and take
  account of the <i>Hour</i>, and of the <i>Perpendicular height</i>: that
  we may see, whether those in <i>September</i>, or those of
  <i>November</i> be highest: And it were not amiss, the Low waters were
  observed too. Which may be easily done by a mark made upon any standing
  Post in the Water, by any <!-- Page 298 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page298"></a>{298}</span>Water-man, or other understanding Person,
  who dwells by the Water-side.</p>

  <p>It would also deserve (thinks he) to be inquired into, whether, when
  the Tides be highest, the Ebbs be ever lowest, &amp; <i>contra</i>;
  (which is generally affirmed, and almost put out of question) or rather
  (which sutes best with this <i>Hypothesis</i>) whether, when the Tides
  are highest, both in the <i>Annual</i> and <i>Menstrual</i> Periods, the
  Low waters be not also highest; and at Neap Tides, the Ebbes also very
  low.</p>

  <p>He adds, that he should expect, that the Spring Tides now coming, and
  those at the beginning of <i>September</i>, should not be so high, as
  those at the <i>middle</i> of <i>September</i>; and then lower again at
  the <i>beginning</i> of <i>October</i>, and after that, higher at the
  <i>middle</i> of <i>October</i>, and higher yet about the
  <i>beginning</i> of <i>November</i> (at the usual times of
  <i>Spring-tides</i> after the <i>New</i> and <i>Full</i>.)</p>

<hr class="short" />

<h3><i>Considerations and Enquiries concerning </i>Tides<i>, by Sir </i>Robert
Moray<i>; likewise for a further search into Dr. </i>Wallis's<i> newly
publish't </i>Hypothesis<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>In regard that the High and Low waters are observed to increase, and
  decrease regularly at several seasons, according to the Moons age, so as,
  about the <i>New</i> and <i>Full Moon</i>, or within two or three daies
  after, in the Western parts of <i>Europe</i>, the <i>Tides</i> are at the
  <i>highest</i>, and about the <i>Quarter-Moons</i>, at the <i>lowest</i>,
  (the former call'd <i>Spring-tides</i>, the other <i>Neap-tides</i>;) and
  that according to the height and excesses of the <i>Tides</i>, the
  <i>Ebbes</i> in opposition are answerable to them, the heighest Tide
  having the lowest Ebbe, and the lowest Ebbe, the highest Tide; the Tides
  from the <i>Quarter</i> to the <i>highest Spring-tide</i> increasing in a
  certain proportion; and from the <i>Spring tide</i> to the
  <i>Quarter-tide</i> decreasing in like proportion, as is supposed: And
  also the <i>Ebbes</i> rising and falling constantly after the same
  manner: It is wished, that it may be inquired, in what proportion these
  Increases and Decreases, Risings and Fallings happen to be in regard of
  one another?</p>

  <p>And 'tis supposed, upon some Observations, made in fit places, by the
  above-mentioned Gentleman, though, (as himself acknowledges) not
  thoroughly and exactly performed, that the Increase of the Tides is made
  in the <i>Proportion</i> of <i>Sines</i>; the first Increase exceeding
  the lowest in a small proportion; the next in a greater; the third
  greater than that; and so on to the mid-most, whereof the excess is
  greatest, diminishing again from that, to the highest Spring-Tide; so as
  the proportions, before and after the <i>Middle</i>, do greatly answer
  one another, or seem to do so. And likewise, from the <i>highest
  Spring-tide</i>, to the <i>lowest Neap-tide</i>, the <i>Decreases</i>
  seem to keep the like proportions; the <i>Ebbes</i> rising and falling in
  like manner and in like proportions. All which is supposed to fall out,
  when no Wind or other Accident causes an alteration. <!-- Page 299
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page299"></a>{299}</span></p>

  <p>And whereas 'tis observed, that upon the main Sea-shore the Current of
  the Ebbings and Flowings is sometimes swifter, and sometimes slacker,
  than at others, so as in the beginning of the Floud the Tide moves faster
  but in a small degree, increasing its swiftness constantly till towards
  the <i>Middle</i> of the Floud; and then decreasing in velocity again
  from the <i>Middle</i> till to the top of the High water; it is supposed,
  that in Equal spaces of Time, the Increase and Decrease of velocity, and
  consequently the degrees of the Risings and Fallings of the same, in
  Equal spaces of time, are performed according to the <i>Proportion</i> of
  <i>Sines</i>.</p>

  <p>But 'tis withall conceived, that the said <i>Proportion</i> cannot
  hold <i>exactly</i> and <i>precisely</i>, in regard of the
  <i>Inequalities</i>, that fall out in the <i>Periods</i> of the
  <i>Tides</i>, which are commonly observed and believed to follow certain
  <i>Positions</i> of the <i>Moon</i> in regard of the <i>Equinox</i>,
  which are known not to keep a <i>precise</i> and <i>constant</i> Course:
  so that, there not intervening equal portions of Time between one New
  Moon and another, the Moons return to the same <i>Meridian</i>, cannot be
  alwaies perform'd in the same Time; and consequently there must be a like
  Variation of the Tides in the Velocity, and in the Risings and Fallings
  of the Tides, as to equal spaces of time. And the Tides from New-moon to
  New-moon being not alwaies the same in number, as sometimes but 57,
  sometimes 58, and sometimes 59, (without any certain order of succession)
  is another evidence of the difficulty of reducing this to any great
  exactness. Yet, because 'tis worth while, to learn as much of it, as may
  be, the <i>Proposer</i> and many others do desire, That Observations be
  constantly made of all these Particulars for some Months, and, if it may
  be, years together. And because such Observations will be the more easily
  and exactly made, where the Tides rise highest, it is presumed, that a
  fit <i>Apparatus</i> being made for the purpose, they may be made about
  <i>Bristol</i> or <i>Cheap-stow</i>, best of any places in
  <i>England</i>, because the Tides are said thereabout to rise to ten or
  twelve fathoms; as upon the coast of <i>Britanny</i> in <i>France</i>,
  they do to thirteen and fourteen.</p>

  <p>In order to which, this following <i>Apparatus</i> is proposed to be
  made use of. In some convenient place upon a Wall, Rock, or Bridge,
  &amp;c. let there be an <i>Observatory</i> standing, as neer as may be to
  the brink of the Sea, or upon some wall; and if it cannot be well placed
  just where the Low water is, there may be a Channel cut from the Low
  water to the bottom of the Wall, Rock, &amp;c. The Observatory is to be
  raised above the High water 18. or 20. foot; and a Pump, of any
  reasonable dimension, placed perpendicularly by the Wall, reaching above
  the High water as high as conveniently may be. Upon the top of the Pump a
  Pulley is to be fastned, for letting down into the Pump a piece of
  floating wood, which, as the water comes in, may rise and fall with it.
  And because the rising and falling of the water amounts to 60. or 70.
  foot, the Counterpoise of the weight, that goes into the Pump, is to hang
  upon as many Pulleys, as may serve to make it rise &amp; fall within the
  space, by which the height of the Pump exceeds the height of the Water.
  And because by <!-- Page 300 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page300"></a>{300}</span>this means the Counterpoise will rise and
  fall slower; and consequently by less proportions, than the weight it
  self, the first Pulley may have upon it a Wheele or two, to turn
  <i>Indexes</i> at any proportion required, so as to give the minute parts
  of the motion, and degrees of risings and fallings. All which is to be
  observed by <i>Pendulum-watches</i>, that have <i>Minutes</i> and
  <i>Seconds</i>, with <i>Checks</i>, according to Mr. <i>Hugens's</i>
  way.</p>

  <p>And because if the Hole, by which the water is let into the Pump, be
  as large as the Bore of the Pump it self, the weight that is raised by
  the water, will rise and fall with an Undulalation, according to the
  inequality of the Sea's Surface, 'twill therefore be fit, that the Hole,
  by which the water enters, be less than half as bigg as the Bore of the
  Pump; any inconvenience that may follow thereupon, as to the Periods and
  Stations of the Floud and Ebb, not being considerable.</p>

  <p>And to the end, that it may appear the better; what are the
  <i>particular</i> Observations, desired to be made, near <i>Bristol</i>
  or <i>Cheap-stow</i> bridg, it was thought not amiss, to set them down
  distinctly by themselves.</p>

  <p>1. The degrees of the Rising and Falling of the water every quarter of
  an hour (or as often as conveniently may be) from the Periods of the
  Tides and Ebbs; to be observed night and day, for 2 or 3 months.</p>

  <p>2. The degrees of the velocity of the Motion of the Water every
  quarter of an hour for some whole Tides together; to be observed by a
  second <i>Pendul</i>-watch: and a logg fastened to a line of some 50
  fathoms, wound about a wheel.</p>

  <p>3. The exact measures of the Heights of every utmost High-water and
  Low-water, from one Spring-tide to another, for some Months or rather
  Years.</p>

  <p>4. The exact Heights of Spring-tides and Spring-Ebbs for some Years
  together.</p>

  <p>5. The Position of the Wind at every observation of the Tides; and the
  times of its Changes; and the degrees of its Strength.</p>

  <p>6. The State of the Weather, as to Rain, Hail, Mist, Haziness, &amp;c,
  and the times of its Changes.</p>

  <p>7. At the times of observation of the Tides, the height of the
  <i>Thermometer</i>; the height of the <i>Baroscope</i>; the height of the
  <i>Hygroscope</i>; the Age of the Moon, and her <i>Azimuths</i>; and her
  place in all respects; And lastly the <i>Sun's</i> place; all these to
  <i>minutes</i>.</p>

  <p>And it would be convenient, to keep <i>Journal Tables</i>, for all
  these Observations, each answering to its day of the Month.</p>

  <p>For the <i>Apparatus</i> of all these observations, there will be
  particularly necessary.</p>

  <p>A good <i>Pendulum</i>-watch.</p>

  <p>A <i>Vane</i> shewing <i>Azimuths</i> to minute parts.</p>

  <p>An <i>Intrument</i> to measure the Strength of the Winde.</p>

  <p>A large and good <i>needle</i> shewing <i>Azimuths</i> to degrees.
  <!-- Page 301 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page301"></a>{301}</span></p>

  <p><i>Thermometers</i>, <i>Barometers</i>, <i>Hygroscopes</i>.</p>

  <p>These Observations being thought very considerable as well as curious,
  'tis hoped, that those who have conveniency, will give encouragement and
  assistance for the making of them; and withall oblige the publick by
  imparting, what they shall have observed of this kind: The
  <i>Publisher</i> intending, that when ever such observations shall be
  communicated to him, he will give notice of it to the <i>publick</i>, and
  take care of the improvement thereof to the best use and advantage. A
  <i>Pattern</i> of the <i>Table</i>, proposed to be made for observing the
  <i>Tides</i>, is intended to be published the next opportunity, God
  permitting.</p>

  <p>This Book (as the Title it self intimates) undertakes two things.
  <i>First</i>, To give an Account of the <i>Second</i> of the two late
  Comets, which appeared, when the <i>other</i> was scarce extinct;
  Concerning which, the Author doth, from the Observations made by himself
  with a <i>Sextant</i> of 6 foot, and divided into <i>minutes</i> and
  <i>seconds</i>, assign <i>both</i> its true place (as well in respect of
  the <i>Ecliptick</i> as the <i>Æquator</i>) <i>and</i> its proper motion;
  Adding a fair Delineation of its Course, together with the genuine
  Representations of its <i>Head</i> and <i>Train</i>, in each day of its
  apparition; and subjoyning a General Description and Discourse of some of
  the more notable <i>Phenomena</i> thereof. It was first seen at
  <i>Dantzick</i> by the Watchmen, the 5th of <i>April</i> st. n. 1665. and
  then observed by the <i>Author</i> from <i>April</i> 6, about 1½ of the
  Clock in the morning, till <i>April</i> 20 at 3. in the morning. During
  which time, it went with a reasonable velocity; making 46 deg. in its
  Orb, <i>according to the Order of the Signs</i>, moving from the
  <i>Breast</i> of <i>Pegasus</i>, towards the <i>Head</i> of
  <i>Andromeda</i>, and the <i>Left Horn</i> of <i>Aries</i>; having, as
  'tis presumed, taken its rise from above <i>Sagittary</i>, and run
  through the <i>Breast</i> of <i>Antinous</i>, under <i>Aquila</i> and the
  <i>Dolphin</i>, to the said <i>Pegasus</i>; and so on, as is already
  expressed.</p>

  <p>The <i>Head</i> of it is in the Book described of a Colour like that
  of <i>Jupiter</i>, all along much brighter than that of the former Comet,
  though of a somewhat less magnitude; having in its middle onely
  <i>one</i> round, but very bright and big <i>Kernel</i> or Speck,
  resplendent like Gold, and encompassed with another more dilute and
  seemingly uniform matter: its <i>Tail</i> being at first, about 17. deg.
  and afterwards 20. and sometimes 25 deg. long, and divaricated towards
  the End.</p>

  <p><i>Next</i>, it is observed, that though this Star did afterwards
  slacken its pace, yet it retained the vividness of its Colour, both of
  the <i>Head</i> and <i>Train</i>; the <i>Head</i> especially, keeping at
  the time as well of the last observations, as of the <!-- Page 302
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page302"></a>{302}</span>first, the
  brightness of its single <i>kernel</i>, though the environing more dilute
  matter were then almost all lost; it being, according to the Author, more
  and more attenuated, and grown narrow, the nearer the Star approached to
  the Sun.</p>

  <p><i>Thirdly</i>, 'tis noted, That this <i>Comet</i> did very much
  digress from the <i>Hypothesis</i>, delivered by <i>M. Auzout</i>, in
  regard that, whereas according to that <i>Hypothesis</i>, this Star
  should not arrive to the <i>Ecliptick</i> till after the space of 3
  months, it arrived there the 28 of <i>April</i>. And then, that its first
  Conjunction with the Sun hapned between the 19 and 20 of <i>April</i>,
  and the second, the last of <i>April</i>, not (as <i>M. Auzout</i>, would
  have it) the 15 of <i>May</i>. So that he concludes, that this Comet
  never came down to the <i>Pleiads</i> and the <i>Eye of Taurus</i>, as
  the Hypothesis of <i>M. Auzout</i> requires, but that from <i>April</i>
  20. it did immediately take its course towards the Ecliptick, deflecting
  every day more and more from the <i>Section</i> of a <i>Great Circle</i>,
  to the <i>Lucida</i> of <i>Aries</i>, arriving at the <i>Ecliptick</i>
  the last of <i>April</i>, about the 8th or 10th deg. of <i>Taurus</i>;
  not in <i>July</i> about the 8th of <i>Gemini</i>, and the <i>Eye of
  Taurus</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Fourthly</i>, He intimates, that if this Comet had appeared some
  weeks sooner, it would have confronted the former Comet, being yet in its
  vigour and of a conspicuous bigness, in the same place, where that was,
  viz. the <i>Head of Aries</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Fifthly</i>, He observes, that this Star in progress of time became
  <i>Retrograde</i>, whence it came to pass, that in the Months of
  <i>June</i> and <i>July</i> it did not appear again before the Rising of
  the Sun, though the Sun left it far behind: whereas, if it had proceeded
  toward the <i>Eye of Taurus</i>, it would have appeared again in the
  morning.</p>

  <p><i>Sixthly</i>, He maintains, that this Comet was not the same with
  the former; which he thinks may be demonstrated, onely by a due
  Delineation of both their Course upon the <i>Globe</i>; where he saith it
  to be evident, that the former could never come to the <i>Head</i> of
  <i>Pegasus</i>, as moving already in <i>February</i> in a streight Course
  about the <i>Head</i> of <i>Aries</i>; Besides, that the <i>former</i>
  went in the very beginning in a <i>Retrograde</i> motion; but <i>this</i>
  perpetually in a direct one: <i>that</i>, about the end, very slow, its
  Head lessning and growing dark; <i>this</i> swift enough, with its head
  conspicuous and bright. To which he adds, that the whole Course of the
  former was made under a quite different <i>Angle</i> of the <i>Orbite</i>
  and <i>Ecliptick</i>, and a different Motion of the <i>Nodes</i> from the
  latter: As also that their <i>Faces</i> differed very much from one
  another; the <i>first</i> exhibiting all along a matter, which as to its
  density and rarity, altered from day to day exceedingly, whereas the
  <i>second</i> retained (to the Authors admiration, who affirms, never to
  have observed the like) all the time he saw it, one and the same round,
  dense and bright Speck or Kernel.</p>

  <p>All which he concludes 1, With an Intimation of his sense concerning
  two other Comets, pretended to have been lately seen, <i>One</i> at
  <i>Rome</i>, about the <!-- Page 303 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page303"></a>{303}</span><i>Girdle of Andromeda</i>, in the Months
  of <i>February</i> and <i>March</i>, 1664. the other in <i>Germany</i> in
  <i>Capricorne</i>, about <i>Saturne</i> in the head of <i>Sagittary</i>,
  during the Months of <i>September</i> and <i>October</i>, 1665. 2ly, With
  an Advertisement of what he has done in that important Work for the
  Advancement of <i>Astronomy</i>, the due <i>Restitution of the Fixt
  Stars, vid.</i> That he has almost finish't it; himself alone, without
  trusting to any other mans labour, that was not directed by him.</p>

  <p>The <i>Second</i> Part of this Book (the <i>Mantissa</i> to the
  <i>Prodromus Cometicus</i>) endeavours to justifie the Authors
  Observations touching the former Comet, excepted against by M.
  <i>Auzout</i>, in several particulars; as 1. That it had not pass'd to
  the <i>First</i>, but <i>Second</i> Star in <i>Aries</i>, and had mov'd
  in quite another Line, than He had described. 2. That its <i>proper
  motion</i> about the end of <i>January</i> and the beginning of
  <i>February</i>, 1665. had not been rightly assigned. 3. That the
  <i>Bignesse</i> of its <i>Diameter</i> had not been truly delivered; Nor
  4. The <i>Faces</i> of its <i>Head</i> in due manner represented.</p>

  <p>To all which the Author endeavors to answer: 1. By delivering all his
  Observations of that Comet, thereby to shew, what care and diligence he
  had used, <i>particularly</i> to make out, how great its <i>Diurnal
  motion</i> had been; in what proportion, and how far, it decreased, and
  where and in what degree it increased again: Which being, as he
  conceives, duly and exactly deduced, and demonstrated, he esteems it
  afterwards to be easie for every one, versed in these matters, certainly
  to collect and to judge, what way the Comet, after it became invisible to
  the naked Eye, and could be no longer observed with <i>Sextants</i> and
  <i>Quadrants</i>, had taken, and what Line it had described. 2, By
  subjecting all those Observations, with great diligence and labour, to a
  rigid <i>Calculus</i>, thereby to obtain, for every day, the
  <i>Longitudes</i>, <i>Latitudes</i>, <i>Right Ascensions,
  Declinations</i>, <i>Proper motion</i>, <i>Angle</i> of the
  <i>Ecliptick</i> and the <i>Æquator</i>, and the <i>Nodes</i> of that
  Comet; for the construction of an <i>Ephemerides</i> of its whole Motion.
  From all which he pretends to prove, that he has not erred in his
  Observation of <i>February</i> 18, nor been prepossest by any
  <i>Hypothesis</i>, nor deluded by any <i>Fixt Star</i>, as M.
  <i>Auzout</i> thinketh; but that near the <i>First Star</i> of
  <i>Aries</i> there <i>then</i> appear'd a <i>Phænomenon</i>, most like to
  that Comet, that was seen some dayes before, if compared with the
  Observations make thereof <i>Febr.</i> 12, 13, 14. Though he will not
  hitherto positively determine, whether that <i>Phænomenon</i>, which
  appear'd to him <i>February</i> 18. was <!-- Page 304 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page304"></a>{304}</span>indeed that very Comet,
  which he saw with his naked Eye, and observed with his Geometrical
  Instruments, the said 12, 13, and 14. dayes of <i>February</i>; or
  whether it was another, and whether he had lost that Comet, which moved
  towards the <i>Second Star</i> in <i>Aries</i>: but leaves it to the
  Learned World, and particularly to the <i>Royal Society</i>, after they
  shall have well examined and considered all his Observations, and the
  <i>Calculus</i> raised therefrom, to judge of this, and the other
  particulars in controversie.</p>

  <p>II. <i>Isaacus Vossius de NILI et ALIORUM FLUMINUM ORIGINE</i>. It was
  <i>Numb.</i> 14. of these <i>Transactions</i>, that gave an account of
  the <i>Cause</i> of the <i>Inundation of the Nile</i>, as it was rendred
  by Monsieur <i>de la Chambre</i>: <i>This</i> is to give you another, not
  only of the <i>Inundation</i>, but also of the <i>Origine</i> of that,
  and of <i>other Rivers</i>, as it is delivered by Monsieur <i>Isaac
  Vossius</i>, who undertakes in this Book to shew;</p>

  <p>1. That those <i>Subterraneous Channels</i>, through which several
  <i>Philosophers</i> teach, that the Sea discharges it self into the
  Rivers, are not only imaginary, but useless, in regard 'tis impossible
  for the water to rise from the Subterraneous places up to the Mountains,
  where commonly the Sources of Rivers are.</p>

  <p>2. He explicates, why, if a Pipe be put into a Bason full of Water,
  the water is seen more raised in the Pipe, than in the Bason, and rises
  higher according as the Pipe is narrower; On the contrary, if the same
  Pipe be put into a Bason full of Quicksilver, the Quicksilver stayes
  lower in the Pipe, than in the Bason. The reason, which he renders
  hereof, is, That as the Water sticks easily to all it touches, it is
  sustain'd by the sides of the narrow Pipe wherein it is included: And
  indeed, if the Pipe be quite drawn out of the Water, the Water doth not
  all fall out, but so much of it remains, as the sides of the Pipe could
  sustaine: Whence it is, that the Water which is kept up by the Walls of
  the Tube, weighing no longer upon that which is in the Bason, is thrust
  upwards, and keeps it self raised above its Levell; but the Quicksilver
  not adhering so easily, as Water, to Bodies it touches, is not sustained
  by the sides of the Tube, and so mounts not above its Levell, but rather
  descends below it, because the Pipe, which is streight, hinders the
  endeavor that is in the <i>Mercury</i> to rise to its Level. He adds,
  that this Observation makes nothing for the Explication of the <i>Origine
  of Rivers</i>; because, though it be true, that the Water <!-- Page 305
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page305"></a>{305}</span>by this means
  rises above its Levell, yet it does never run out at the top of the Pipe.
  Having said this, he answers to the other Arguments, commonly alledged to
  maintain this Opinion.</p>

  <p>3. He pretends, that all Rivers proceed from a <i>Colluvies</i> or
  <i>Rendevous</i> of Rain-waters, and that, as the Water, that falls upon
  <i>Hills</i>, gathers more easily together, than that which falls in
  <i>Plaines</i>, therefore it is, that Rivers ordinarily take their Source
  from <i>Hills</i>. Thence also comes it (saies he) that there are more
  <i>Rivers</i>, than <i>Torrents</i>, in the <i>Temperate Zones</i>; and,
  on the contrary, more <i>Torrents</i>, than <i>Rivers</i>, in the
  <i>Torrid Zone</i>: For, as in hot Climats the Mountains are far higher,
  the Water, that descends from them with impetuosity, runs away in a
  little while, and formes such Collections of Water, as soon dry up, but
  in cold Climats, the Waters do not run away but slowly, and are renew'd
  and recruited by Rain, before they are quite dryed up; because the Hills
  are there lower, and so the Bed of Rivers hath lesse declivity.</p>

  <p>Having thus discoursed of <i>Rivers</i> in <i>General</i>, he treats
  of the <i>Nile</i> in <i>particular</i>; and there</p>

  <p>1. Observes, That the Order of the Seasons of the Year is quite
  inverted under the <i>Torrid Zone</i>. For, whereas it should be then
  Summer, when the Sun is near; and Winter, when the Sun is farther off:
  Under the <i>Torrid Zone</i> 'tis never lesse hot, than when the Sun is
  nearest; nor more hot, than when the Sun is farthest off: So that to the
  people that live between the <i>Æquinoctial</i> and the <i>Tropicks</i>,
  Summer begins about <i>Christmass</i>, and their Winter, about St.
  <i>Johns</i> day. The reason whereof is, (<i>saith he</i>) that when the
  Sun is directly over their Heads, it raises abundance of vapors, and
  draws them so high, that they are presently converted into Water by the
  coldnesse of the Air; whence it comes to passe, that then it rains
  continually, which does refresh the Air; but when the Sun is farther off,
  there falls no more rain, and so the Heat becomes insupportable.</p>

  <p>2. He proves by many recent Relations, that the <i>Sources</i> of the
  <i>Nile</i> are on this side of the <i>Æquinoctial</i> in
  <i>Æthiopia</i>, of which he gives a very accurate <i>Mappe</i>,
  correcting many faults which <i>Geographers</i> are wont to commit in the
  Description of the Kingdom of the <i>Abyssins</i>, which they believe to
  be much greater than indeed it is. <!-- Page 306 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page306"></a>{306}</span></p>

  <p>3. This supposed, he easily gives an account, why the <i>Nile</i>
  yearly overflows about the end of <i>June</i>: For, as at that time there
  falls much rain in <i>Æthiopia</i>, it must needs be, that the
  <i>Nile</i>, whose source is in that Country, should then overflow, when
  those rains begin, and subside, when they cease.</p>

  <p>There are besides, in this Book, two other <i>Tracts</i>. In the
  <i>first</i>, M. <i>Vossins</i> endeavours to maintain the Doctrine, he
  had deliver'd in his Book <i>De Lumine</i>, and to shew, that the
  <i>Soul</i> of Animals is nothing but <i>Fire</i>, that there are no
  invisible Atoms; nor so much as any Pores, even in the Skin of man. Here
  he treats also of <i>Refractions</i>, and alledges the Examples of
  several persons, who have then seen the Sun by the means of Refraction,
  when really He was under the <i>Horizon</i>.</p>

  <p>In the <i>second</i>, He discourses of some points of the
  <i>Mechanicks</i>; and relates among other things, that the <i>Arrows</i>
  and <i>battering Rams (Aries)</i> of the Antients did as much execution,
  as our <i>Muskets</i> and <i>Canons</i>; and then, that the Vehemence of
  the percussion depends as much upon the Length of the percutient Body, as
  upon the velocity of the Motion. He adds, that the Length of a Canon
  ought not to exceed 13 foot, and that a greater length is not onely
  useless, but hinders also the effect of the Gun, not because the Bullet
  is thrown out of the Gun, before all the powder is fired (as some
  believe;) but because the Bullet is then beaten back into the Gun by the
  Air, re-entring into it with impetuosity, when the flame is extinct.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>III. <i>LE DISCERNEMENT DU CORPS ET DE L'AME</i>, par M. <i>de
  Cordemoy</i>.</p>

  <p>This <i>French</i> Treatise (but very lately come to the
  <i>Publisher's</i> hands) examines the different Operations of the Soul
  and Body, and the Secret of their Union, pretending to discover to every
  one, what he is, and what is transacting within him. It consists of six
  Discourses.</p>

  <p>1. In the <i>first</i>, the Author examines the Notions, we have in
  <i>general</i> of <i>Bodies</i> and <i>Matter</i>; of <i>Quantity</i>; of
  <i>Qualities</i>; of <i>Place</i>; of <i>Rest</i>; of <i>Motion</i>; of
  <i>Vacuity</i>; of <i>Forms</i>: to shew what is to be understood by
  these Terms, which cause all the perplexity that is in the ordinary
  <i>Physicks</i>. He begins with taking notice, that hitherto
  <i>Philosophers</i> have had no <i>distinct</i> notions of <i>Bodies</i>
  and <i>Matter</i>, from the want whereof he conceives, that almost all
  the Errors in Common <i>Physiology</i> have <!-- Page 307 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page307"></a>{307}</span><span
  class="sidenoter">* <i>It sounds hard, To say, An </i>extended<i>
  substance is </i>indivisible<i>.</i></span> sprung. To rectify which, he
  defines <i>Bodies</i> to be * <i>Extended Substances</i>, and
  <i>Matter</i> an <i>Aggregate of Bodies</i>. Whence he inferrs, that
  <i>Bodies</i> are Indivisible and <i>Matter</i> divisible; a <i>Body</i>
  being nothing but <i>one</i> and the <i>same</i> substance, whose
  different extremities are inseparable, because they are the extremities
  of one and the same Extension, and, in a word, of one and the same
  Substance; but <i>Matter</i> being nothing but an Association or
  Collection of Bodies, 'tis evident, (<i>saith he</i>) it must be
  divisible. This doctrine he so much insists upon, that he conceives,
  Nature cannot subsist, if a Body in the sence he takes it, be divisible;
  and that <i>Motion</i> and <i>Rest</i> cannot be explicated without it.
  As for <i>Quantity</i>, he makes that to be nothing but More or Less
  Bodies; not allowing, that each Body should be a Quantity, though it be a
  part of Quantity; no more than an <i>Unite</i> is a Number, though it
  make part of a Number: so that <i>Quantity</i> and <i>Extension</i> are
  two distinct things with him, the <i>first</i> belonging properly to
  <i>Matter</i>, the last to a <i>Body</i>. Touching <i>Vacuity</i>, he
  conceives, that the Bodies, which compose a mass, are not every where so
  near one another, as not to leave some interval in several places.
  Neither does he think it necessary, that those intervals should be fill'd
  up; nor unconceivable, that there should be no Body between two Bodies;
  which touch not one another. And when 'tis said, that those intervals
  cannot be conceived without Extension, and that consequently there are
  Bodies that replenish them, he frankly pronounces that not to be true;
  and affirms, that though it may be said, that between two Bodies, which
  touch not one another, other Bodies may be placed of so or so many feet,
  &amp;c: yet ought it not to be inferred, that therefore they <i>are</i>
  there, but onely, that they are thus placed, that there <i>may</i> be put
  between them so many Bodies, as joyned together would compose an
  Extension of so many feet. So that one conceives onely, that Bodies
  <i>may</i> be placed there, but not that they <i>are</i> there: and as we
  can have an <i>Idea</i> of many Bodies, though none of them be in being;
  so we can conceive, that some Bodies <i>may</i> be put between others,
  where really there are none. And when 'tis alledged, that if all the
  Bodies, that fill a vessel full, were destroyed, the sides of the vessel
  would be closed together; He professes, he understands not that
  ratiocination, nor can conceive, what one Body does to the subsistence of
  another, more than to sustain themselves mutually, when they are thrust
  by the neighbouring ones: and therefore sees not, why the sides of the
  vessel should close, if nothing did thrust them together; but understands
  clearly, that two Bodies may well subsist so far from one another, that
  one might place a great many Bodies between them, or none at all, and yet
  they neither approach to, not recoil from one another. <!-- Page 308
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page308"></a>{308}</span></p>

  <p>2. In the <i>Second</i>, he examines the <i>Changes</i>, which he
  knows in Matter, and makes it his business to explicate all those that
  respect <i>Quantity</i>, <i>Qualities</i> and <i>Forms</i>, by <i>Local
  Motion</i>, esteeming that needs no other.</p>

  <p>3. In the <i>third</i>, he explains the Motion of <i>Artificial</i>
  Engins, and that of <i>Natural</i> ones, by one and the same Cause;
  endeavouring among other things to shew, that the Body of an Animal is
  moved after the same manner with a Watch. That cause of motion he makes
  the <i>Materia Subtilis</i>; and the finer or subtiler that is, the
  better and fitter he conceives it to be to preserve Motion.</p>

  <p>4. In the <i>Fourth</i>, he teaches, that though Experience seems to
  evince, that the Soul moves the Body, and that one Body moves an other;
  yet there is nothing but God, that can produce any notion in the World,
  and all other Agents, which we believe to be the <i>Cause</i> of this or
  that Motion, are no more but the <i>Occasion</i> thereof. In doing this,
  he advances certain <i>Axioms</i>, and Conclusions, which are in
  short,</p>

  <p>a. The <i>Axioms</i>: That no substance has that of it self, which it
  can loose, without ceasing to be, what it is: That every body may loose
  of its motion, till it have no more left, without ceasing to be a Body:
  That we cannot conceive but two sorts of substances, <i>vid.</i> a
  <i>Spirit</i> (or <i>That which thinketh</i>) and a <i>Body</i>,
  wherefore they must be considered as the Causes of all, that happens, and
  what cannot proceed from the one, must necessarily be adscribed to the
  other: That to <i>Move</i>, or to cause motion, is an Action: That an
  Action cannot be continued but by the Agent, who began it.</p>

  <p>b. The <i>Conclusions</i>: That no <i>Body</i> hath Motion of it self:
  That the First Mover of Bodies not a Body: That it cannot be but a
  <i>Spirit</i>, that is the First Mover: That it cannot be but the same
  Spirit, who has begun to move Bodies, that continues to move.</p>

  <p>In the <i>Fifth</i>, He treats of the Union of the Body and Soul, and
  the manner, how they act one upon the other; and esteems it not more
  difficult to conceive the Action of Spirits upon Bodies, and of Bodies
  upon Spirits, than to conceive the Action of Bodies upon Bodies: the
  cause of the great difficulty in understanding the two former, arising
  (according to him) from thence, that we will conceive the one by the
  other, not considering, that every thing acting according to its own
  nature, we shall never know the action of one Agent, if we will examine
  it by the notions we have of another, that is of a quite differing
  nature. Here he notes, that the Action of Bodies upon Bodies is not <!--
  Page 309 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page309"></a>{309}</span>more
  known to us; than that of Spirits upon Bodies, or of Bodies upon Spirits;
  and yet most men admire nothing but <i>this</i>, believing to know the
  <i>other</i>; whereas he Judges, that all things being well examin'd, the
  Action of Bodies upon Bodies is no more conceivable, than that of Spirits
  upon Bodies. Mean while the opinion of the Authour touching this subject,
  is, That the union of Soul and Body consists onely in this, that certain
  motions of the Body are followed by certain <i>Cogitations</i> of the
  Soul, and, on the contrary, that certain Thoughts of the Soul are
  follow'd by certain <i>Motions</i> of the Body. And, having supposed,
  that Bodies are said to act upon one another, when they cause some change
  suitable to Extension; and Spirits to act upon one another, when they
  cause some change suitable to a Thought; he infers, that when a Body acts
  upon a Spirit, that cannot be by causing any change of motion, of figure,
  or parts, as having none of all these; nor when a Spirit acts upon a
  Body, that cannot be by producing any change of Thought, as having none:
  But, when this Body, or its motion, or figure, or other thing, depending
  upon its nature, can be perceived by a Spirit, so as, upon that occasion,
  this Spirit has thoughts, it had not before, it may be said, that the
  Body has acted upon this Spirit, for as much as it has caused all the
  change in it, whereof it was capable according to its nature.</p>

  <p>In the <i>Sixth</i>, After he hath shew'd, what is to be understood by
  what we call <i>Soul</i>, and by what we call <i>Body</i>, he labours to
  make it out, that we are much more assured of the Existence of the Soul,
  than of that of the Body, which he conceives he can prove from hence,
  that we cannot doubt, that we think, because even doubting is thinking;
  but one may doubt, whether one has a body, for several reasons, which he
  alledges, and thinks so cogent, that he concludes, it is not evident to
  him by the light of reason, that he has a Body. But supposing, there be
  Bodies, he examines, what are the Operations, that belong to the Soul,
  and what those, that belong to the Body; and lastly, what those, that
  result from the Union of both: And then explains, how all those
  operations are perform'd, and particularly, <i>Sensation</i>; where he
  shews, that the Nerves, holding at one end to the Brain, whereof they are
  but Allongations, and being at the other end extended to the extremities
  of the Body; when an Object comes to touch those exterior ends of the
  Nerves, the interior ones in the Brain are presently shaken; and cause
  different sensations according to the diversitie of Nerves, and the
  differing manner, in which they are shaken. And to shew, that 'tis this
  shaking, that causes Sensation, he notes, that if any thing shakes the
  interior parts of the Nerves, though the object be absent, the Soul has
  presently the same <!-- Page 310 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page310"></a>{310}</span>sensations, as it would have, if it were
  present. As, if one should knock on's head forcibly against a wall, the
  shaking, which the blow gives to the Brain, moving the interior
  extremities of the Nerve, which causes the sensation of Light, the Soul
  has the same sensation, which it would have, if it saw a thousand
  Candles: On the contrary, if the interior extremities of the nerves are
  not shaken, though the object be present, it causes no sensation; whence
  it comes, that if a strong Ligature be made upon the middle of the Arm,
  and the hand be then prickt, no pain is felt, because the shaking of the
  nerves that are pricked, being stopped by the Ligature, cannot reach to
  the extremities of the Nerves, that are within the Brain.</p>

<h3><i></i>Patterns<i>
of the </i>Tables<i> proposed to be made for </i>Observing of Tides<i>, promised
in the next foregoing </i>Transactions<i>; by Sir </i>Rob. Moray<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>In performance of what was promised in the last of these <i>Papers</i>
  for Observing the <i>Tides</i>, here are subjoyned <i>Patterns</i> of the
  <i>Tables</i> there mentioned; <i>One</i>, for <span class="correction"
  title="Original reads `making', corrected by errata, page 352."
  >marking</span> the <i>precise Time</i> of the High waters and Low-waters
  during one Month; that is, between <i>New</i> and <i>New</i> Moon, or
  <i>Full</i> and <i>Full</i> Moon. The <i>other</i>, for marking the
  <i>Degrees</i> of the Risings and Fallings of the Water in <i>Equal</i>
  spaces of Time, and the <i>Velocity</i> of its motion at <i>several</i>
  heights: The <i>Degrees</i> of <i>Heat</i> and <i>Cold, &amp;c.</i></p>

  <p>The <i>Times</i>, assigned in the <i>first</i>, to the High waters and
  Lowest Ebbs, are taken out of Mr. <i>Wing</i>'s Almanack, for this
  present year 1666, as he calculates them for the Month of
  <i>September</i> for <i>London Bridge</i>. Only, whereas he takes notice
  but of <i>one</i> High-water for every day, <i>Here</i> are set <!-- Page
  312 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page312"></a>{312}</span>down the
  Times of the other, and the two Ebbs intervening, by subdividing the
  <i>Differences</i>, he assignes between two Tides, equally amongst them.
  In all which, though there may be Errors, that is not to be considered,
  seeing the Dissein is to Correct and State the <i>Times</i> of the
  <i>Tides exactly</i> by <i>Experiments</i>, after this method. Mr.
  <i>Wing</i> states the High waters to fall out at <i>London-Bridge</i>
  constantly, when the Moon is 46. deg. 30. min. to the <i>West-ward</i> of
  the <i>Meridian</i>. For the Times, he marks for them, are made up by
  adding every day 3. hours, 6 minutes, to those in his <i>Table</i> for
  knowing the Time of the Moons coming to the South.</p>

  <p>The <i>First Table</i> consists of <i>two</i> Parts, and each part of
  <i>four Columns</i>. The <i>first</i> part marks the Tides and Ebbs from
  the day of the <i>New</i>-Moon to its <i>Full</i>: The <i>other</i>, from
  the <i>Full</i> to the next <i>New</i>. The <i>first Column</i> in both
  parts hath the day of the Month and Week; <i>M.</i> standing every where
  for <i>Morning</i> and <i>A.</i> for <i>Afternoon</i>. The <i>third</i>
  column hath the <i>Character</i> of the day of the Week prefixt to the
  Hour and Minute of the High-water, and answering to the day of the Month.
  The <i>last</i> Column hath the same for the time of Low-water, varying
  the <i>Character</i> of the day, as often as the low-water falls out more
  early than the High-water. In this <i>Example</i> between the said
  <i>New</i> Moons there falls out in all just 57. periods of the Tide or
  Flowing water, and 58. of the Ebb or Low water; which numbers vary
  according to the Intervals of the Moons changes, but with what constancy
  and exactness, is to be inquired after: Which whosoever undertakes to do,
  may keep such a <i>Table</i>, as is here proposed, in a Book by it
  self.</p>

  <p>The <i>other</i> Table doth in 9. <i>Columns</i> comprehend the
  particular Observations of the <i>Degrees</i> of the Rising and falling
  of the Tides, and the other things specified at the Tops of them: The
  <i>first</i> Column marking the Hour and Minut common to all the several
  Observations. Each hour is divided in 3. equal Parts, that number of
  Observations being only pitch't upon by way of <i>Example</i>: The
  numbers may else be varied at pleasure, when other more frequent
  Observations are thought fit to be made, or when they prove too frequent
  and laborious; though the most frequent are most desirable, till
  competent information of all particulars be attained.</p>

  <p>The <i>Rising</i> of the Tide from Low-water to the highest pitcht of
  the full Sea, is here supposed to be 60. foot: And the Degrees of its
  rising every 20. Minuts, to be in the <i>Proportion</i> of <span
  class="correction" title="Original reads `Signes', corrected by errata, page 352."
  ><i>Sines</i>,</span> The whole time of Flowing supposed to be 6. hours.
  But this <i>Example</i> will serve for marking the <i>Spaces</i> of the
  Increasing or Rising, as well as of the falling of the water, in order to
  the investigation of their <i>Proportions</i> to one another, when the
  <i>Duration</i> of the Tide exceeds 6. hours by any number of
  <i>minuts</i>, as well as for just 6. hours; seeing they may be easily
  collected from any Number of Observations; their precise Time and that of
  the Duration of the waters Rising and Falling (that is, the just interval
  between the High-Water and Low-water) being known: This Calculation by
  <span class="correction" title="Original reads `Signes', corrected by errata, page 352."
  ><i>Sines</i>,</span> being only set down as a <i>Conjecture</i>, flowing
  from Observations of the Motion of the water in its Rising and Falling,
  <!-- Page 313 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page313"></a>{313}</span>which seems to observe this or some such
  like Proportion; which is supposed still to hold in <i>all</i> Tides, be
  the <i>Duration</i> what it will; the Increase still continuing
  proportionably till the very midle of the Hight and Duration, and
  Decreasing afterwards in the same manner: Which whether it be so indeed
  or not, is that, which is desired to be known.</p>

  <p>There is the like Proportion here supposed to be in the <i>different
  degrees</i> of the <i>Velocity</i> of the Current of the Water after
  <i>Equal</i> spaces of Times, as in its Rising and Falling: And so it is
  markt in the <i>Third</i> Column. But because the <i>true Velocity</i> of
  the Current of the Water, raised above the Levell
  <sup>456</sup>/<sub>1000</sub> of a foot, is unknown, it is by way of
  Supposition set at Ten feet in one Minute of an Hour, which being once
  stated, the rest distant from each other by the space of 20. Minutes of
  an Hour, are set down according to the same <i>Proportions</i> of <span
  class="correction" title="Original reads `Signs', corrected by errata, page 352."
  ><i>Sines</i></span> before suggested. It being supposed, that of the
  <i>Velocity</i> of the Current of the Tide, after it hath flowed 20
  minuts of an hour, be such, as a Log of Wood placed in the Water will
  move 10 foot in the space of one minute of time, at the middle of the
  Tide it will in the like space of Time move 114 f.
  <sup>276</sup>/<sub>1000</sub>, and so proportionably at other times:
  Which, howsoever these Proportions shall be found by Experiments to fall
  out, may be not unworthy of the pains and charges requisite to acquire
  the knowledge of it. For, besides the satisfaction it may afford upon
  other accounts, it may possibly be of no small use to those, who need an
  exact reckoning of their Ships running, when the Velocity of the Current
  of the Tide may be necessary to be known; lest through the defect of the
  knowledge of that, especially when it is reckoned less than indeed it is,
  the Ship be thrown in the night upon Shores, Rocks or Sands, when they
  reckon themselves to be far from them.</p>

  <p>The Numbers in the 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. <i>Columns</i> are set down at
  random, only for <i>Examples</i> sake; there being no difficulty in the
  apprehension of it, and imitating of it in setting down the true Hights
  and Variations of the <i>Thermometer</i>, <i>Baroscope</i>, &amp;c. The
  Use whereof is so vulgarly known, that there needs no further Direction
  concerning them. But if any person who would make these Experiments, do
  not know the fabrick or use of any of the Instruments requisite for some
  of these Observations, nor where to have them, he may address himself to
  Mr. <i>Shortgrave</i>, one of the <i>Operators</i> of the <i>Royal
  Society</i>, lodged in <i>Gresham Colledge</i>, from whom he will receive
  full satisfaction about these things.</p>

  <p>But the labour employed in the Observations of the Heat, Cold, &amp;c.
  required to be taken notice of in order to the Ends proposed in the
  former <i>Tract</i>, and others that may be of no less delight than
  advantage, will be much retrenched, when Dr. <i>Christopher Wren</i> puts
  in practice, what he some years ago proposed to the <i>Royal Society</i>
  concerning an <i>Engine</i> with a <i>Clockwork</i>, which may perform
  these Observations in the last enumerate <i>Columns</i>, without being
  toucht or lookt after but once or twice a day.</p>

<h3><i>Some Considerations
concerning the </i>Parenchymous<i> parts of the Body.</i></h3>

  <p>These were communicated by the inquisitive M. <i>Edmund King</i> at
  the Instance of the <i>Publisher</i>, as follows;</p>

  <p>The <i>Parenchymous</i> parts of the Body, are by <i>Anatomists</i>
  generally supposed to be in very many places wholly <i>void of
  Vessels</i>; designed chiefly to fill up Cavities and interstices between
  the Vessels, and to boulster up the same, and to convey them through the
  parts.</p>

  <p>But having many years endeavoured to excarnate several parts of the
  Body, <i>viz.</i> the Liver, Lungs, Spleen, Kidneys, &amp;c. (not to name
  the <i>Placenta Uteri</i>, which seems to be <i>Parenchymous</i> too;)
  and being very desirous to make a <i>Scheme</i> of the Vessels of any of
  these, what ever they were, I fixt upon; I found, notwithstanding all my
  care to preserve the Vessels, when I was freeing them, as heedfully as I
  could, from the supposed <i>Parenchyma</i>, that in every breach, I made,
  either with my fingers or otherwise, all my endeavors were destructive to
  my purpose: and <span class="correction" title="Original reads `if', corrected by errata, page 352."
  >that</span>, upon examination of those bits, much of which is called
  <i>Parenchyma</i>, I met in them more Vessels, than I had preserved in
  the parts whence they came: And though the portion were never so small,
  yet my bare eye could make this discovery; much more could I, when
  assisted by a <i>Microscope</i>, perceive, I had destroyed more Vessels
  than preserved, in despite of the exactest care, I was capable to use.
  And being not a little concern'd, that I should undertake to preserve the
  Vessels by such a Cause, as I saw plainly to be their definition (were
  the part never so big, or never so small) I was both confounded and
  tired. For I saw (and so must any, that will attempt this work) in my
  endeavouring to preserve one Vessel of a traceable magnitude, I spoiled
  an infinite number of others less discernable, which were as truly
  Vessels, as the other, differing only in size and figure (as to
  appearance.) Then reviewing what mischief I had done in every place,
  quite through the whole Tract of my Fingers, Knife, &amp;c. I begin to
  think with my self, That it was not impossible for these parts to consist
  wholly of Vessels curiously wrought and interwoven (probably for more
  Uses, than is yet known;) And the <!-- Page 317 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page317"></a>{317}</span>consideration, which
  came into my mind, of a piece of fine Cloth (which consists of so many
  several minute Hairs, call'd <i>Wool</i>) was no discouragement to this
  opinion. Yet I durst not be presumptuous as to indulge my self too much
  in it; much less to venter presently to speak of such a thing, which
  seem'd to contradict so many Learned Men's belief. But being restless,
  till I might receive more satisfaction in the thing, I iterated
  experiments over and over; some of which prov'd so successful to my
  apprehension, that I was encouraged in the year 1663. and 1664 to
  discourse of it to several very worthy Persons, as Mr. <i>Boyl</i>, Sir
  <i>William Petty</i>, Dr. <i>Williams</i>, Dr. <i>Lenthal</i>, Dr.
  <i>Jaspar Needham</i>, Dr. <i>Samson</i>, (who afterwards sent me a
  Letter from <i>France</i>, intimating the acquaintance he had made with
  the learned <i>Steno</i>, who hath since published something of the same
  Discovery) Mr. <i>Daniel Cox</i>, and Dr. <i>Samuel Parker</i>, &amp;c,
  who doubtless cannot but remember, that then I related to them, I found
  much cause to believe, that that substance commonly called
  <i>Parenchyma</i>, was in most, if not in all its <i>Parenchymous</i>
  parts, full of Vessels; however it had been imagin'd by all, I could ever
  meet with, to consist in great part of a substance, in many places void
  of Vessels, designed for such uses, as are above mentioned.</p>

  <p>Against which I have now further to alledge, 1. That I observe in a
  piece of <i>Musculous</i> flesh (so call'd) either raw, rosted, or
  boiled, <i>&amp;c.</i> that if I so far extend it as to make it to be
  seen through, I can (assisting my Eye) perceive it full of Vessels placed
  as thick as is possible to be imagin'd, (the fat if there be any, being
  first removed) there appearing then nothing but vessels, yet so as with a
  <i>Microscope</i> may be seen through, when they are extended. 2. That,
  if any one, as he is at dinner, take a piece of flesh, and begin either
  at the head or tail of a <i>Muscle</i>, he may divide it <i>in
  infinitum</i> all along from head to tail, without breaking any thing of
  that, called Flesh, only these transverse <i>Fibres</i>, that seem to
  stitch them together, and (as I am apt to think) pass through the very
  Bodies of the smallest of them, and quite through the whole Muscle up the
  Cutaneous porosities; so that there is not one of these small
  <i>ducts</i>, that run <i>per longitudinem</i>, but 'tis furnisht with a
  sufficient number of outlets, when need requires, though too minute to
  suffer any <i>alimentary</i> juice to pass transversly (in a living Body)
  or any other liquor, when the Body is dead and cold. But to wave their
  use at present, and to return to what I was saying. Compress between the
  fingers this bit of flesh, and you shall find the Juice, especially if
  the Meat be Hot, to go before your fingers toward either end you please;
  but if you compress both ends, you shall see it swell into the middle;
  and again, if you press the middle, it will run out at both ends. But
  further, suppose a piece of flesh, called <i>Parenchyma</i>, as big, or
  as little as you please, in any part of the Body, and let me prick it
  with a Needle, where you shall appoint; if you feel it, I presume you
  will acknowledge, a <i>Nerve</i>, or a <i>Fibrilla</i>, related to it, is
  touch'd; If you feel it not, I am sure some liquor either sanguineous or
  other, will follow the Needle; And from whence can that come, but out of
  Vessels? unless <!-- Page 318 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page318"></a>{318}</span>accidentally, as by a <i>Contusion</i>,
  &amp;c., it be extravased, in which case my Argument will not be injured,
  because the part is depraved, whereas I speak of the parts, as they are
  in their natural State.</p>

  <p>To confirm and illustrate all which, I desire, that the following
  <i>familiar</i> Observations may be considered:</p>

  <p>1. If a Horse, fat and fair to look on, without a hollow to be seen
  between his Muscles, be rid extreme hard, and into a great sweat, and
  then kept one day without water or moist meat, you shall see him took so
  thin in many places as in the <i>musculous</i> parts, that you will
  hardly believe it to be the same Horse, especially if he be (as the
  Phrase is among Horse-masters) a <i>Nash</i> or <i>Wash-Horse</i>. The
  cause of which thinness will easily be granted to be only an exhaustion
  of Juice, expended out of the Blood, which did stuff out these Vessels.
  And whoever, that is used to ride hard, shall observe, how thick this
  foul Horse breaths, and at what a rate he will reek and sweat, will not
  much wonder at the alteration. But if the Horse be a hardy one, and used
  to be hard ridden, then you will see, that one days rest, and his belly
  full of good meat and drink, will in one day or two almost restore him to
  his former plight, the food being within that short space of time so
  distributed, that all the Vessels will be replenish'd again, as before.
  And the cleaner the Horse is, the sooner recruited, and the less sign of
  hard riding will appear. This seems to shew the facility, with which the
  Juice, called Blood, passeth; Which surely, if there were such a thing as
  a <i>Parenchyma</i> might by several accidents (not difficult to mention)
  be so deprav'd in several parts of it, that it might lose its receptive
  faculty; than which it may be thought to have none of greater use, being
  supposed to be without Vessels.</p>

  <p>2. Discoursing sometimes with <i>Grasiers</i> in the Country, about
  the Pasture of Cattle, I have been informed by them, that, if they buy
  any Old Beasts, Oxen, or Cows to feed, they choose rather those that are
  as poor as can be, so they be sound; because that, if they are pretty
  well in flesh, what they then add to them by a good pasture, though it
  make them both look and sell well, yet it will not make them eat so well,
  their flesh proving hard and very tough: Which some may suppose to be the
  age of <i>Parenchyma</i>; and so it is of that so called. But if those
  Beasts be old and extremely poor, then they feed very kindly, and will be
  not only very fat but spend well, like young ones, and eat very
  tender.</p>

  <p>Of which I take the reason (excluding a <i>Parenchyma</i> now) to be
  this. When an Oxe or a Cow is grown old, and in an indifferent plight as
  to his <i>flesh</i> (for so it is called) all those Vessels having been
  kept at that size for the most part, have contracted a tenseness and
  firmness, and their <i>fibers</i> less extensive, nor so fitted for the
  reception of more unctuous particles to relaxe them; and that additional
  unctuous matter, which occasions fatness, is forced to seek new quarter
  any where (often remote from Muscles) where it can be with least
  difficulty received; sometimes to one place, sometimes to <!-- Page 319
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page319"></a>{319}</span>another, as
  may be seen in Shambles. Whereas, if there were such a thing as a
  <i>Parenchyma</i>, that certainly would, like a hungry Sponge,
  immediately swell up in several parts, (which without much difficulty
  might be discover'd in the dissection) and more eminently, where it
  should find the pores most potent: And in the dissection of such Muscles
  it would be very strange, not to find some, if not many, pieces of them
  in various shapes, to the great inconvenience of the parts, in which they
  are seated: Which yet I confess I could never find in any Muscle unless
  it were where there had been a <i>Contusion</i>, or an <i>Impostume</i>,
  or the like. But according to my opinion of the <i>Parenchymous</i>
  parts, the reason, why the Flesh of a very lean Ox or Cow, that hath got
  new Flesh in a good pasture, eats tenderer, seems to be this: That in a
  very lean Beast the Vessels designed for admitting and distributing the
  nourishing Juice, are so near contracted, and lye so close together;
  that, when once they are relax'd; by fresh and unctuous nourishment, they
  extend every way in all <i>extensive</i> parts, until in a short time the
  whole Creature is, as it were, created a new, having got new flesh upon
  old bones. And the necessity of extreme extension makes all those parts,
  that are, as has been said, for the admission of nourishment, so thin and
  fine, that it will make the lean Beast, put into a rich pasture, eat
  young and tender: Whereas one of the same Age, that never was very poor,
  fed in the same pasture, shall eat hard and tough.</p>

  <p>3. It has been observed, that Corpulent Persons in some Diseases, that
  seize on them, do fall away to wonder, not only in the Wast, but in the
  Arms, Legs, and Thighs; and the very Calves of the Legs have been
  observed so flaccid and loose, that one might wrap the skin about the
  bones. The reason whereof, according to the opinion deliver'd, may be
  easily rendred to be, A great Consumption of the Stock of Liquors, that
  in Health kept the Vessels turgid; Which Vessels I suppose to make up
  those Muscles. But when the Pores are obstructed, that the nourishment is
  hindred (which then also uses to be but sparingly administred) and
  sweats, either spontaneous, or forced, are large, there must needs be a
  great expence of those Liquors, the supply being but inconsiderable:
  which cannot but contract all these ducts of all sorts nearer together,
  and make them much less in themselves, meerly from Exhaustion: Or, if
  there should be no sweats, the internal Heat spends the spirits, and
  dries up the Liquors; the consequence whereof may reasonably be presumed
  to be this Flaccidity of parts, and great and sudden Change, made in
  them; not that there is need of any <i>Parenchyma</i> to fill up these
  Muscles considering what hath been said. Mean while, I humbly conceive,
  that if it be in any part of a Muscle, their Ingenuity, that plead for
  it, will put them upon some experiments, to bring it to Ocular
  Demonstration, either in Living or Dead Muscle, any kind of flesh, raw,
  rosted, boyl'd, or in what they can best make it out. And when I shall be
  convinc'd of an Errour in what I have discoursed, I shall beg pardon for
  giving the Occasion of the trouble of that Experiment, which shall prove
  a <!-- Page 320 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page320"></a>{320}</span><i>Parenchyma</i> in any Muscle; and think
  my time well spent in receiving a full satisfaction of the ungroundedness
  of my opinion; and readily submit to the Author, with a grateful
  acknowledgement of my Obligation to any one that shall rectifie me in my
  mistake, if it be one.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<h3><i>Observables
touching </i>Petrification<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>Though much hath been already said and written of
  <i>Petrification</i>, yet 'tis conceived, that all that comes so far
  short of a competent stock for the composing of a perfect <i>History of
  Petrification</i>, that the incompleatness thereof ought to awaken the
  more diligent attention of the Curious, and to call in their aid for
  Additions, thereby so to encrease and to complete the <i>Materials</i>
  for that work, that it may the better serve to clear and make out the
  Cause of that Transmutation. And that the rather, because if it lay in
  the power of humane Skill (by the knowledge of <i>Nature</i>'s works) to
  raise <i>Petrification</i>, or to allay, or prevent it, or to order and
  direct it (which perchance in time might be attained the said way) much
  use might be made of this Art; especially if it could be made applicable
  to hinder the Generation of the Stone and Gravel in humane Bodies, or to
  dissolve the Stone, where 'tis formed; besides other valuable Uses, that
  might be excogitated.</p>

  <p>Upon this Consideration, care is, and further <i>will be</i> taken in
  these Papers, to record, among other Observables of Nature, what shall be
  communicated of this kind of <i>Change</i>.</p>

  <p>In <i>Num.</i> 1. 2. and 5. several Relations have been made belonging
  to this Argument. Much of it, together with considerable Reflections may
  be seen in Mr. <i>Boyle</i>'s <i>Essay of Firmness</i>: In <i>Helmont de
  Lithiase</i>, where, among other remarques, is recited the Testimony of
  <i>Paræus</i> of a <i>Petrified Child</i> seen at <i>Paris</i>, and by
  the Owner used for a <i>Whetstone</i>: In <i>Densingius</i>'s Historia
  <i>Infantis in Abdomine inventi, &amp; in duritiem lapideam conversi</i>:
  In Mr. <i>Hook</i>'s <i>Micrography</i>, and in others. To omit now, what
  has been related (but perhaps not well enough attested) by Authors,
  concerning the stupendious Petrifications of whole Companies of Men, and
  Troops of Cattle; by <i>Aventinus</i>, lib. 7. <i>Annal. Bojorum</i>; by
  <i>Purchas</i> in his <i>Pilgrimage</i> p. 416. in fol. printed at
  <i>London</i> 1614, and, (of a Troop of <i>Spanish</i> Horsemen) by
  <i>Jos. Acosta</i> lib. 3. c. 9.</p>

  <p>To all which, the curious Dr. <i>Beale</i> now adds a Narrative of a
  Stone, not long since taken out of the Womb of a Woman of his
  neighbourhood neer <i>Trent</i> in <i>Somersetshire</i>, by incision, and
  afterwards perfectly cured, though she had born the Stone with extreme
  torments for. 8. or 9. years. The operation he relates to have been made
  in <i>Easter</i> last; after which time, he affirms to have seen the
  Stone, and weigh'd it in Gold Scales, where it wanted somewhat of four
  Ounces, but had lost of the weight, it formerly had, <!-- Page 321
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page321"></a>{321}</span>being very
  light for a Stone of that Bulk. He further describes to be of a whitish
  colour, lighter than Ash-colour; perchance (<i>saith he</i>) not unlike
  to that recited out of <i>Scaliger</i> by Mr. <i>Boyle</i> in his
  <i>Essay of Firmness</i> pag. 238. <i>qui aëris contactis postea in
  gypseam tum speciem tum firmitatem concreverat</i>. It had no deep
  asperities, and had somewhat of an Oval figure, but less at one end, than
  a Hen-Egge, and bigger and blunter at the other end, than a Goose
  egge.</p>

  <p>This Stone, (so he concludes) is intended for the <i>Royal
  Society</i>, with the Testimony of the <i>Chirurgion</i>, that perform'd
  the Operation, and other Witnesses of special credit; where also will be
  annexed the <i>manner</i> of Operation.</p>

  <p>It appears by this last clause (to add that on this occasion) that
  this Well-wisher to the Improvement of all usefull knowledge, has taken
  notice of that considerable <i>Collection of Curiosities</i>, lately
  presented to the lately nam'd Society for their <i>Repository</i>, by the
  Publick-minded Gentleman Mr. <i>Daniel Colwall</i>, a very worthy and
  useful Member of that Body: To which Repository whatsoever is presented
  as rare and curious, will be with great care, together with the <i>Donors
  names</i> and their <i>Beneficence</i> recorded, and the things preserved
  for After-ages, (probably much better and safer, than in their own
  private Cabinets;) and in progress of Time will be employed for
  considerable Philosophical and Usefull purposes; of which perhaps more
  largely in another place.</p>

<h3><i>A Relation
of a kind of </i>Worms<i> that eat out Stones.</i></h3>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>This is taken out of a Letter, written by one <i>M. de la Voye</i> to
  <i>M. Auzout</i>, to be found in the 32. <i>Journal des Scavans</i>; as
  follows.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In a great and very ancient Wall of Free-Stone in the <i>Benedictins
  Abby</i> at <i>Caen</i> in <i>Normandy</i>, facing Southward, there are
  to be found many Stones so eaten by Worms, that one may run his hand into
  most of the Cavities which are variously fashion'd, like the Stones,
  which I have seen wrought with so much Art in the <i>Louvre</i>: In these
  cavities there is abundance of live-Worms, their excrement, and of that
  Stone-dust, they eat. Between many of the Cavities there remain but
  leaves, as it were, of Stone, very thin, which part them. I have taken
  some of these living Worms, which I found in the eaten Stone, and put
  them into a Box with several bits of the Stone; leaving them there
  together for the space of eight days; and then opening the Box, the Stone
  seem'd to me eaten so sensibly, that I could no longer doubt of it, I
  send you the Box and the Stones in it, together with the living Worms:
  and to satisfie your Curiosity, I shall relate to you, what I have
  observed of them both <i>with</i> and <i>without</i> a <i>Microscope</i>.
  <!-- Page 322 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page322"></a>{322}</span></p>

  <p>These Worms are inclosed in a Shell, which is grayish and of the
  bigness of a Barly-corn, sharper at one end, than the other. By the means
  of an excellent <i>Microscope</i> I have observ'd, that 'tis all
  overspread with little Stones and little greenish Eggs; and that there is
  at the sharpest end a little hole by which these Creatures cast out their
  excrement, and at the other end, a somewhat bigger hole, through which
  they put out their heads and fasten themselves to the Stones, they gnaw.
  They are not so shut up, but that sometimes they come out, and walk
  abroad. They are all black, about two <i>Lines</i> of an inch long and
  three quarters of a <i>Line</i> large. Their Body is distinguish't into
  several plyes, and near their head they have three feet on each side,
  which have but two Joynts resembling those of a Lowse. When they move,
  their Body is commonly upwards, with their mouth against the Stone. They
  have a big head, somewhat flat, and even, of the colour of a
  Tortoise-Shell, braunish, with some small white hair. Their mouth is also
  big; where may be seen four kinds of Jaw-bones, lying crossewise, which
  they move continually, opening and shutting them like a pair of
  <i>Compasses</i>, with four branches. The Jaws on both sides of the mouth
  are all black, the nether Jaw hath a point like the Sting of a Bee, but
  uniform. They draw threds out of their mouth with their fore-feet, using
  that point to range them, and to form their Shells of them. They have Ten
  Eyes, very black and round, which appear to be bigger than a Pins head.
  There are five of them on each side of the head, standing after this
  manner,</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:8%;">
      <a href="images/VI_N18_Fig2.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/VI_N18_Fig2.png"
      alt="Fig. 2." title="Fig. 2." /></a>
  </div>
  <p>But besides these Worms, I have found, that <i>Mortar</i> is eaten by
  an infinite number of small Creatures, of the bigness of Chees-Mites.
  These have but two Eyes, and are blackish. They have four feet on each
  side pretty long. The point of their Muzzle is very sharp, as that of a
  Spider. I send you but one of them, though I had abundance, but they are
  dead and lost. It may be, you'l find some at <i>Paris</i>, seeing that in
  the old Mortar betwixt Stones, that is found in Walls made with rubbish,
  there is great store of them, together with great plenty of their little
  Eggs. I have not yet examined, whether these be those, that in the
  surfaces of all the Stones, where they are met with, make little round
  holes, and small traces and impressions, which make them look like
  <i>Worm-eaten Wood</i>. But 'tis probable, they are such. It should be
  observed, whether these Worms do not take Wings, and all the other
  appearances of Caterpillars; and whether they are not to be found in
  plaister that is full of holes, in Bricks, in Greety Stones, and in
  Rocks.</p>

  <p>You may observe more of them in Walls exposed to the <i>South</i>,
  than in others; and that the Worms, that eat the Stone, live longer, then
  those, <!-- Page 323 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page323"></a>{323}</span>that eat the Mortar, which keep not above
  eight days alive. I have observed all their parts with a very good
  <i>Microscope</i>, without which, and a great deal of attention, 'tis
  difficult to see them well.</p>

  <p>I have seen other very old Walls altogether eaten, as those of the
  <i>Temple</i> at <i>Paris</i>, where I could find no Worms, but the
  Cavities were full of Shells of various kinds, diversly figur'd and
  turn'd: all which I believe to be little Animals petrified.</p>

  <p>His words are these, in a Letter to the <i>Publisher</i>, of the 24.
  <i>Septemb.</i> 1666 at <i>Yeovill</i> in <i>Somersetshire</i>;</p>

  <p>I have two or three remarks, perhaps not unworthy to be recorded for
  further application in like cases of time and place</p>

  <p>1. In the Moores from hence towards <i>Bridgewater</i>, in the extreme
  drought, we have endured this Summer, some lengths of pasture grew much
  sooner whithered and parched, than the other pasture. And this Parched
  part seem'd to bear the length and shape (in gross) of Trees. They
  digg'd, and found, in the place, <i>Oakes</i> indeed, as black as Ebony.
  And hence they have been instructed to find and take up many hundreds of
  Oakes, as a neighbour of good credit assures me. This advertisement may
  be instructive for other parts, as <i>Kent</i>, <i>Essex</i>,
  <i>Lincoln</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<div class="sidenoter">* <i>This had somewhat of a Vitriolate taste. But the Experiment being made with greater quantities of this water, which questionless will be done, the nature and kind of it may be better known.</i></div>
  <p>2. My Cosen <i>Philips</i> of <i>Montague</i> has in his pastures of
  <i>Socke</i>, about three miles off, a large Pool, to which Pigeons
  resort; but the Cattle will not drink of it, no not in the extream want
  of water in this drought. To the taste it is not only brackish, but hath
  other loathsome tasts. In a Venice-glass it looked greenish and clear,
  just like the most greenish Cider as soon as it is perfectly clarified. I
  boyl'd a Pint of it in a Posnet of Bell-Mettall (commonly used to
  preserve Sweatmeats:) suddenly it yeilded a thick froth, whence I scumm'd
  half a score Spoonfulls; of which the inclosed is a part, * Suffering the
  water to be boyl'd all away, it left much of the same on the sides and
  bottom of the Posnet.</p>

  <p>3. From <i>Lamport</i>, towards <i>Bridge water</i>, Eeles are so
  cheap in the frosts of Winter, that they vend them for little. Their
  abundance is from hence, that as the people walk, in the frosty Mornings,
  on the banks of river, they discern, towards the edges of the banks, some
  parts <i>not hoar</i>, as the rest, but <i>green</i>; where searching the
  holes of the banks they find heaps of Eeles.</p>

<h3><i>A Problem
for finding the Year of the </i>Julian Period<i> by a new and very easie
Method.</i></h3>

  <p>This occurs in the <i>Journal des Scavans</i> n<sup>o</sup>. 96. as it
  had been proposed communicated to the Learned <i>Jesuit DE BILLY</i>.
  viz.</p>

  <p>Multiply the <i>Solar</i> Cycle by 4845. and the <i>Lunar</i>, by
  4200. and that of the <i>Indiction</i>, by 6916. Then divide the Sum of
  the Products by 7980. which is the <i>Julian Period</i>: The
  <i>Remainder</i> of the Division, without having regard to the
  <i>Quotient</i>, shall be the year required after.</p>

  <p>E. g. Let the Cycle of the <i>Sun</i> be 3; of the <i>Moon</i> 4; and
  of the <i>Indiction</i>, 5. Multiply 3. by 4845, and you have 14535; and
  4. by 4200. comes 16800; and 5. by 6916. comes 34580. The Sum of the
  products is 65915, which being divided by 7980. gives 8. for the
  <i>Quotient</i>, and the number 2075. which remains, is the Year of the
  <i>Julian Period</i>.</p>

  <p>Some learned Mathematicians of <i>Paris</i>, to whom the said <i>P. de
  Billy</i>, did propose this <i>Problem</i>, have found the Demonstration
  thereof; as the same <i>Journal</i> intimates.</p>

  <p>This Treatise, published the last year, would sooner have been taken
  notice of in these <i>Tracts</i>, had it not escaped the
  <i>Publishers</i> view till of late, when he, upon serious perusal, found
  it very worthy the recommending it to all sorts of persons; and
  particularly to those who either please themselves with that fond
  opinion, <i>That Philosophy is the Apprentiship of Atheisme</i>; or
  hearken to the aspersions, that are generally laid upon the
  <i>Reformation</i> of <i>Philosophy</i>.</p>

  <p>This excellent piece removes both these; and being joyned and compared
  with the truly Noble Mr. <i>Boyle</i>'s Considerations in his <i>First
  part</i> of the <!-- Page 325 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page325"></a>{325}</span><i>Usefulness of Experimental-Natural
  Philosophy</i>, will strongly evince, How Much that Philosophy, which
  searches out the real Productions of Nature (the true Works of God) does
  manifest the Divine Glory more, than the Notionals of the Gentiles.</p>

  <p>This Author (now a Fellow of the <i>Royal Society</i>) delivers his
  Matter in two Books.</p>

  <p>Lib. 1. Cap. 1. Atheists are disappointed of the Authority of
  <i>Epicurus</i>, and of other Antient Philosophers, for their gross
  Atheisme.</p>

  <p>Cap. 2. The beautiful Frame of the World evinceth the Architectonical
  Author and Governor.</p>

  <p>Cap. 3. The admirable Contrivance in the Structure of Mankind, and of
  Animals, does more conspicuously shew the Deity.</p>

  <p>Cap. 4. The Atheist caught in his own Net, or convinced by the true
  force of his own Arguments.</p>

  <p>Cap. 5. The Arguments devised against Atheists by <i>Des Cartes</i>,
  and drawn from the <i>Idea's</i> of our Mind, examin'd and found
  imperfect and invalid.</p>

  <p>Lib. 2. Cap. 1. The opinions of the Gentiles concerning God, unduly
  applied to the <span class="correction" title="Original reads `Diety'."
  ><i>Deity</i></span>, which we worship: but properly to be understood by
  them of the <i>Sun</i>, or of the <i>Soul of the World</i>.</p>

  <p>Cap. 2. More expresly proved, that the Antient Philosophers conceived,
  the <i>Soul of the World</i> to be God.</p>

  <p>Cap. 3. The Historical Theology of the Gentiles for the most part is
  unduly applyed or accommodated to the Holy Scriptures.</p>

  <p>Cap. 4. The Divine Substance, Immensity, Incomprehensibility,
  Invisibility, explicated, as far as our weak reason does teach.</p>

  <p>Cap. 5. The Divine Perfections, and other Attributes and Affections,
  how far explicable.</p>

  <p>Cap. 6. The Eternity of God, how apprehended.</p>

  <p>These are in short the Heads of the Book, which is yet but in Latin.
  It were to be wisht, the Author would make it speak his own lively
  <i>English</i>.</p>

  <p>II. HONORATI FABRI <i>Soc. Jesu Theologi, Tractatus duo; quorum Prior
  est de Plantis &amp; de Generatione Animalium; Posterior de
  Homine.</i></p>

  <p>As the Matter of this Book is considerable, so is the order and
  dependence of all its parts excellent; in regard that all the
  Propositions are ranged according to a Geometrical method, and so well
  disposed, that the latter do always suppose the former, and seem to
  depend all of them upon certain evident principles, whence they flow by a
  natural consequence.</p>

  <p>This <i>Volume</i> contains two Treatises.</p>

  <p>The <i>First</i> is divided into 5. Books. In the <i>four first</i>,
  he treats of <i>Plants</i>, and distributes them into three
  <i>Classes</i>; some growing <i>in the Earth</i>, as <i>Trees</i>;
  others, growing upon <i>Plants</i>, as <i>Mosse</i>; and a third sort
  growing upon <i>Animals</i>, as <i>Hair</i>, <i>Horns</i>, and
  <i>Feathers</i>. He examins and considers the <!-- Page 326 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page326"></a>{326}</span>Parts of all these
  Plants and their Use, the manner, how they are produced, and nourished;
  and their different Qualities. He discourses also of Bread, Wine, Oyle,
  and the other Mixtures, that are made of Plants.</p>

  <p>In the <i>Fifth Book</i>, he treats of the <i>Generation of
  Animals</i>, where he delivers many curious matters, explicating in a
  very easie and familiar way that Argument, which hath always been lookt
  upon, as one of the obscurest in Natural Philosophy.</p>

  <p>The <i>Second</i> Treatise consists of 7. Books; wherein the Author
  considers, what appertains to <i>Man</i>. He discourses <i>first</i>, of
  Digestion, of the Circulation of the Bloud, and of the Use of the
  principal parts of the Humane Body. <i>Next</i>, he treats of the Senses,
  External and Internal; of all the Motions of the Body, both Natural and
  Voluntary, of the sensitive Appetite, and the Passions; <i>Thence</i> he
  proceeds to the Temperaments, Habits, Instinct, Sleep, Sickness,
  <i>&amp;c.</i> <i>Lastly</i>, passing to the <i>Rational Soul</i>, he
  endeavours to demonstrate the Immortality thereof, and to explain also
  the Manner, how it worketh upon the Body, and is united with the Body;
  where he omits not to reason of all the Powers of the Soul, of Liberty,
  and of the Operations of the Understanding and Will.</p>

  <p>In <i>general</i>, the Author makes it his study, for the explicating
  of the most perplext Difficulties, to shew, that Nature works not but by
  very simple and easie wayes.</p>

  <p>In <i>particular</i> he intersperses several curious remarks.
  <i>E.g.</i> He teaches how to make <i>Perspectives</i>, that magnifie
  Objects, without Glass; telling us, that when an Object is look't upon
  through a small hole, it appears much greater than it is; and that
  therefore, if instead of Glasses one did cast before ones eyes two
  <i>Plates</i> having little holes in them, it would furnish us with a new
  kind of <i>Perspectives</i>, more commodious than those of Glasses, which
  spoil the Sight by reason of the refraction of the Rayes, caused thereby.
  <i>Again</i>, He renders the cause of that common, but surprising, effect
  of Painters, drawing certain Pourtraictures, which seem to look directly
  upon all their Beholders, on what side soever they place themselves:
  <i>Videl.</i> That in those Pictures, the Nose it a little turned to one
  side, and the eyes to the other. Whence it comes, that such pictures seem
  to look to the right side, because the Eyes are indeed turned that way;
  but they appear also to look to the left, because the point of the Nose
  is turned that way, and the Table, whereon the Picture is drawn, being
  flat the Looker on perceives not, that the Eyes are turned th'other way;
  which he would do, if the Eyes of the Pourtrait were convex: Whence it
  comes, that no Figure can be made embossed, which looks every way.</p>

  <p>The art, which he teaches of making <i>Parsley</i> shoot out of the
  ground in a few hours, is this. Infuse the seed of it in Vinegar; and
  having sown it in good ground cast on it a good quantity of the Ashes of
  Bean-Cods, and sprinkle it with Spirit of Wine, and then cover it with
  some linnen. He mentions also; that if you calcine Earth, and then water
  it well, it will <!-- Page 327 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page327"></a>{327}</span>produce a great variety of different
  Herbs, and that the Ashes of Corn burnt, being sown, have sometimes
  produced other Corn.</p>

  <p>To add that by the by, this Author is not so addicted to
  <i>Aristotle</i>, as to be on his side, when he thinks Truth is not. He
  hath emancipated himself considerably from the <i>Scholastick</i> way of
  Philosophing. He dares maintain, that the Vegetative and Sensitive Souls
  are not <i>Substantial</i> Forms; and that it is with Plants and Animals,
  as with Artificial things, the Form whereof results from the Union and
  Disposition of the parts. According to this <i>Hypothesis</i> he
  explicates all the Operations of Plants and Animals, without having any
  recourse to the Soul. He avers also, that there are no <i>Species
  Intentionales</i>, and no Habitudes, and that the Animal Spirits, which
  Philosophers commonly believe to be necessary for all the Operations of
  Life, are useless.</p>

  <p>It might also be observed out of this Author, what he discourses of
  the Generation of Animals by Putrefaction; of the Cause of intermittent
  <i>Feavers</i>, and of the Animal Instinct, and of many other
  particulars; were it not better to refer the curious to the Book it
  self.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>III. <i>RELATION DU VOYAGE de l' Evesque de Beryte, par la Turquie, la
  Perse, les Indes, </i>&amp;c.<i> jusques au Royaume de Siam, &amp; autres
  lieux</i>; par M. <i>de Bourges, Prestre</i> &amp;c.</p>

  <p>This Author imploying his Pen chiefly, according to his design, to
  give an Accompt of the Success, the Undertakers of this Voyage had, in
  propagating the Christian Faith in the remoter parts of the World, and
  relating on that occasion, What number of Churches they have founded in
  <i>Cochin</i>, <i>China</i>, and the Kingdom of <i>Tonquin</i>, (in which
  latter alone he affirms, that there are more than three hundred thousand
  Christians;) being I say principally intent upon that Subject, he seems
  not to have made many Philosophical observations in those places. Mean
  while he does good service to those that have occasion to travel into the
  <i>East-Indies</i> mostly by Land, by describing the passage, they took
  thither; which was, That they embarqued at <i>Marseilles</i>, in
  <i>September</i>, the most convenient and favourable season for that
  Voyage; whence Ships do ordinarily pass every Month from <i>Syria</i>,
  reckoning one Month for the time of Sayling, to <i>Alexandretta</i>.
  Thence to <i>Aleppo</i>, counting one Month more for the Stay, to be made
  there to meet the <i>Caravane</i> for <i>Babylon</i>, and six weeks more
  for the march from <i>Aleppo</i> to <i>Babylon</i>, where a fortnight
  will pass before an opportunity happen to embarque upon the <i>Tyger</i>
  for <i>Balsora</i>; which Journey will require a fortnight more: And
  about this time it will be about the end of <i>January</i>. Thence is
  always conveniency to pass from <i>Congo</i>, 4 days Journey from
  <i>Comoron</i> or <i>Gombroun</i>, to which latter part there is also
  frequent occasion to pass by Sea from <i>Balsora</i>, which will take up
  some 15 or 16. days Sail. There (vid. at <i>Comoron</i>) you will every
  year meet with <i>English</i>, <i>Portugal</i>, <i>Dutch</i>, and
  <i>Moorish</i> Vessels, from <i>Surat</i>, from <i>October</i> till the
  end of <i>April</i>, for they are obliged to be at <i>Surate</i>, before
  the end of <i>May</i>, because all the ports of those <!-- Page 328
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page328"></a>{328}</span><i>Indies</i>
  are shut the 4. ensuing months, by reason of the danger of that
  <i>Sea</i>.</p>

  <p>But besides this Direction, the Book is not quite destitute of
  <i>Natural</i> Observations. It relates, 1. How Diamonds are found and
  separated in <i>Golconda</i>; They take of the Earth, held to be proper
  to form them, which is reddish, and distinguish'd with white veins, and
  full of flints and hard lumps. Then they put near the places, which they
  will digge, a close and even Earth; and to it they carry those Earths,
  they have digg'd out of the Mine, and gently spread it abroad, and leave
  it exposed to the Sun for two days. Then being dryed enough they beat it,
  and sifting this Earth, they find the Diamonds in ashes of Flints, in
  which Nature hath set them. Here he adds, that the King of that Country
  farms out these Diamond-Mines for 600000. Crowns <i>per annum</i>,
  reserving to himself the right of all the Diamonds, that exceed ten
  <i>Carats</i> in weight. There are Diamonds, that mount to 35. and 40.
  <i>Carats</i>. And this is the great Treasure of that Prince.</p>

  <p>2. That the most esteemed fruit in those parts; the <i>Durion</i> (of
  the bigness and shape of an ordinary <i>Melon</i>) has a very unpleasing
  and uneven untollerable smell, like to that of a rotten <i>Apple</i>.</p>

  <p>3. That <i>Rice</i> prospers most in waterish grounds; and that the
  fields, where it grows best, resembles rather to Marshes, than to any
  ploughed Soyle: Yea, that that Grain has the force, though 6. or 7. foot
  water stand over it, to shoot its Stalk above it; and that the Stem,
  which bears it, rises and grows proportionably to the height of the
  water, that drowns the field.</p>

  <p>4. That the way of keeping ones self harmless from a wild
  <i>Elephant</i>, when he runs directly upon one, is, to hold something to
  him; as a Hat, a Coat, a piece of Linnen, which he seises on with his
  Trunk; and playes with it, as if he were pleased with this apparent
  homage, done to him; and so passes on. If he be in a rage, that then the
  only remedy is, to turn incessantly behind him to the left side, in
  regard that naturally (<i>saith this Author</i>) he never turns himself
  that way, but to the right: And the time, there is to turn, because of
  the Beasts unweildiness, affords leisure enough to climbe up some high
  Tree, or to mount some steep ground: all which if it fail, by holding
  always his tail, and turning with him, the Animal will be tired, and give
  opportunity to escape.</p>

  <p>On a Bank in a Close of Mr. <i>Purefoy</i>, neer his house, call'd
  <i>Wadley</i>, a mile from <i>Farrington</i> in <i>Berks</i>, there grows
  an <i>Elme</i>, which hath now lost the top, and is grown hollow,
  containing neer a Tun of Timber. From the But of the same Tree, one of
  the spreading Clawes having been formerly cut off with an Axe, that part
  of the But, from whence the same was sever'd, being about 1½ foot above
  ground, and inward within the trunk <!-- Page 330 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page330"></a>{330}</span>of the Tree, hath
  contracted a petrfied Crust, about the thickness of a <i>shilling</i>,
  all over the woody part within the Bark; the Marks of the Axe also
  remaining very conspicuous, with this petrified crust upon it. By what
  means it should thus happen, cannot well be conceived, in regard there is
  no water neer it; the part, above the ground and out of the weather; the
  Tree yet growing: unless being cut at some season, when the sap was

  Tree grow rotten and hollow inward since that time; which how long since,

<h3><i>Articles of Inquiries touching </i>Mines<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>What the Honourable <i>Robert Boyle</i> gave the Reader cause to hope
  for, in <i>Numb</i>. 11. when he was pleased to impart those <i>General
  Heads</i> for a Natural History of a Country, <i>there</i> publish'd; He
  is not un-mindful to perform, by enlarging them as occasion serves, with
  <i>Particular</i> and <i>Subordinate</i> Inquiries. Here he gratifies the
  Curious with a considerable Set of Inquiries about <i>Mines</i>: which
  though unfinish'd, yet the <i>Publisher</i>, was instant to obtain their
  present Publication, to the end, that he might the more conveniently
  recommend them to several Forreigners of his Acquaintance, now ready to
  return to their several Countryes, which he understands to abound in
  Mines; and from the Curious Inhabitants whereof, he expects to receive a
  good Accompt upon some at least of these Inquiries; which also by several
  of them have been earnestly desired, as Instructions, to direct them,
  what Particulars to inquire after upon this Subject.</p>

  <p>These Quæries are reduced by the <i>Author</i> to six Heads:</p>

  <p>The <i>first</i>, The neighbouring Country about the Mines.</p>

  <p>The <i>second</i>, The Soyl where the Mines are.</p>

  <p>The <i>third</i>, The Signs of Mines.</p>

  <p>The <i>fourth</i>, The Structure and other particulars belonging to
  the Mines themselves.</p>

  <p>The <i>fifth</i>, The Nature and Circumstances of the Ore.</p>

  <p>The <i>sixth</i>, the Reduction of the Ore into Metal. <!-- Page 331
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page331"></a>{331}</span></p>

<h3><i>QUÆRIES</i></h3>

<h3><i>About the first Title.</i></h3>

  <p>1. Whether the Country be Mountainous, Plain, or distinguish'd with
  Vales? And in case it be mountainous, what kind of Hills they are;
  whether high, or low, or indifferently elevated? Whether almost equal or
  very un-equal in height? Whether fruitful or barren; cold or temperate;
  rocky or not; hollow or solid? Whether they run in ridges, or seem
  confusedly placed; and, if the former, what way the ridges run, North and
  South, <i>&amp;c.</i> And whether they run any thing parallel to one
  another?</p>

  <p>2. Whether the Country be barren or fruitful? And, if any way
  fruitful, what it produces, and what it most abounds with?</p>

  <p>3. What Cattle it nourishes, and whether they have any such thing
  peculiar in point of bigness, colour, shape, longævity, fitness or
  unfitness to make good meat, <i>&amp;c.</i> as may be rather adscribed to
  the peculiar nature of the place, than to the barrenness of the Soyl, or
  other manifest causes?</p>

  <p>4. Whether the Natives, and other Inhabitants, live longer or shorter
  than ordinary? Whether they live more or less healthy? Whether they be
  subject to any <i>Epidemical</i> Diseases, that may very probably be
  imputed to the Mines; and what these Diseases are; and what Remedies are
  found successful?</p>

  <p>5. Whether the Country be, or be not furnish'd with Rivers, Brooks,
  Springs, and other Waters; and how these waters are conditioned?</p>

  <p>6. Whether the Air be dry or moist; hot or cold; clear or foggy; thick
  or thin; heavy or light; and especially, whether the Weather be more or
  less variable than ordinarily; or whether it be subject to great and
  sudden changes, that may probably be imputed to the Mineral and
  Subterraneous Steams; and what they are? <!-- Page 332 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page332"></a>{332}</span></p>

<h3><i>About the second Title.</i></h3>

  <p>7. Whether the <i>Soyle</i> that is neer the Surface of the Earth, be
  Stony; and, if it be, what kind of Stones it abounds with? Whether it be
  Clayie, Marley, Chalkye, <i>&amp;c.</i> And, if it be of several kinds,
  how many they are; and by what properties they are distinguish'd?</p>

<h3><i>About the third Title.</i></h3>

  <p>8. By what <i>Signs</i> they know or guess, that there is a Mine in
  such a place?</p>

  <p>9. These Signs are <i>either</i> upon the Surface of the Earth, <i>or
  beneath</i> it.</p>

  <p>To the <i>former</i> belong these <i>Quæries</i>.</p>

  <p>10. Whether the Ground be made barren by Metalline or Mineral
  Effluviums?</p>

  <p>11. Whether it be observed, that Trees and other greater Plants seem
  to have their tops burnt, or other leaves or outsides discoloured? or
  whether there be any Plants, that do affect to grow over such Mines; and
  whether it have been tryed, that other Plants, that would prosper in the
  adjacent places, will not be made to grow and thrive there?</p>

  <p>12. Whether the Stones and Pebles, that are wash'd by the Brooks,
  Springs, or other Waters, have any colour'd substance left upon them; and
  if they have, of what colour, weight, <i>&amp;c.</i> these adherences
  are?</p>

  evapourated away, do appear to abound with, or to participate of?</p>

  <p>14. Whether <i>Snow</i> will not lye, or <i>Frost</i> continue so
  long, or <i>Dew</i> be generated or stay upon the ground in the place
  proposed, as on other neighbouring grounds?</p>

  <p>15. Whether the <i>Dew</i> that falls on that ground, will discolour
  white Linnen or Woollen-Cloths, spred overnight on the <!-- Page 333
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page333"></a>{333}</span>surface of the

  Lightning, and to sudden Storms or Earthquakes; as likewise to Nocturnal
  Lights and fiery Meteors.</p>

  <p>The <i>second</i> sort of <i>Signs</i> belonging to these
  <i>Quæries</i>, are such as follow.</p>

  <p>20. Whether there be any Clayes, Marles, or other Mineral Earths,
  yellow or liquid matters, that usually give notice of the Ore? And if
  there be more than one, how and at what depths they are wont to lye
  respectively? Of what thickness and consistence they are; and in what
  Order the Diggers meet with them?</p>

  <p>21. Whether there be any Stones or <i>Marchasites</i> to be found
  neer, or not very far from the surface of the ground, by which one may
  have ground to expect a Mine? As is often observed in the Tin-Mines of
  <i>Cornwall</i>, over which such kind of Stones are divers times found
  lying above ground?</p>

  <p>22. Whether all Stones of that kind do equally signify that Mine? And,
  if not, how the significant Stones are to be known, as by Colour,
  Bigness, Shape, Weight, Depth under ground, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

  <p>23. Whether there be any Earths of peculiar kinds, as to Colour,
  Consistence, <i>&amp;c.</i> that indicate a Mine beneath or near them;
  and, if there be, what they are, and what is their consecution, if they
  have any?</p>

  <p>24. Whether Heat or Damps give any assurance or a probability of
  finding a Mine? <!-- Page 334 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  determinate kind of Metals or Minerals; but of the Plenty and Goodness of
  the Vein; and what they are?</p>

  <p>29. Whether there be any Signs of the depth of the Vein beneath the
  surface of the Earth; and what they are?</p>

  <p>30. Whether there be any proper or peculiar Signs, that show it to be

  applicable) till you come at the Vein or Ore?</p>

  <p>32. Whether the Vein run or lye Horizontal, or dippe? And if it dippe,
  what <i>inclination</i> it hath, how deep the lowest part lies; and
  consequently how much deeper than the uppermost? As also, what it's
  Flexures, if it have any, are? And whether it runs directly <i>North</i>

  Casual tendency, than any determinate one by Nature? and how far it
  reaches in all?</p>

  Whether the Groove be perpendicular or crooked; and if crooked, after
  what manner, and with what distance it winds?</p>

  <p>34. How the Groove is supported? What are the kinds, length, bigness,
  and way of placing the Timber, Poles, <i>&amp;c.</i> that are employed to
  support it? And how long the Wood will last, without being spoyled with

  convenient enough, or not? How neer it is placed to the Groove; and in
  what position? And if there be <i>several</i> Air-shafts, what their
  Distances and scituation are in reference to the Groove, and to each
  other? Or how Air is supplied, if there be no Air-shafts?</p>

  <p>36. Whether they meet with any Waters in the Mine? And, if they do,
  how copious they are; at what depths they occur; how they are qualified;
  and what way they Spring, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

  <p>37. Whether they are constant or temporary? whether they increase or

  the proportions of Increase and Decrease?</p>

  <p>38. What Expedients and Engines are employed to free the Mines from

  <p>40. Whether the Mine be troubled with <i>Damps</i>, and of what kind
  they are? whether they come often or seldom at any set time, or
  altogether irregularly? what Signs fore-run them? what mischief they do?
  what remedies are the most successfully imployed against them, aswell in
  reference to the Cleering of the Mine, as to the Preservation and
  Recovery of the Workmen?</p>

  <p>41. What Methods the Mine-men use in following the Vein, and tracing
  their passages under ground (which they call <i>Plumming</i> and
  <i>Dyalling</i>) according to the several exigencies? And whether they
  employ the Instruments, made with the help of the Load-stone, the same
  way that is usual; and if not, wherein they differ in the use of the same
  Instruments; or what Instruments they substitute in their place?</p>

  <p>42. What ways they take to secure themselves from the uncertainty,
  incident to the guidance of <i>Magnetick</i> Needles from the
  <i>Iron-Stone</i> or Ore, that they may meet with under ground? <!-- Page
  336 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page336"></a>{336}</span>(of which
  yet perhaps there is not so great danger, as one may imagine; as far as I
  could find by a Trial, I purposely made in a Groove, where I was sure,
  there wanted not Iron-Ore.) And what other wayes may be used to direct
  Miners without the help of a Load-stone?</p>

  <p>43. How the Miners deal with the Rocks and Sparrs, they often meet
  with, before they come at the Ore? Whether they use Fire to soften,
  calcine, or crack them? How they employ it, and with what measure of
  success?</p>

  Work-men from the inconveniencies and danger accruing from the use of
  much fire in it?</p>

  those Instruments are conducive; and how long they last?</p>

  <p>46. How the Mine-men work; whether naked or cloathed? And what Lights
  they use to work by; what materials they are made of, what measure of

  burning in that thick and foggy air?</p>

  <p>47. How Veins are follow'd, lost, and recover'd? And how several
  Miners work on the same Vein? And what is the best way of getting all the
  Ore in a Vein, and most conveniently?</p>

  <p>48. How they convey out their Ore, and other things, that are to be
  carried out of the Mine? Whether they do it in Baskets drawn up by Ropes,
  or upon Mens backs; and if this last-named way; what kind of Vessels they
  use for matter, shape, and capacity? And whether the Work-men deliver
  them one to another; or the same Work-men carry them all the way? And
  whether the Diggers descend and ascend by Ladders of Wood, or of Ropes,
  <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<h3><i>About the Fifth Title.</i></h3>

  <p>49. Whether the Ore runs in a Vein; or lie dispers'd in scatter'd
  pieces; or be divided partly into a Vein, and partly into loose masses;
  or like a Wall between two Rocks, as it were in a Cleft; or be
  interspers'd in the firm Rock, like speckled Marble? Or be found in
  <i>Grains</i> like <i>Sand</i> or <i>Gravel</i>; as store <!-- Page 337
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page337"></a>{337}</span>of excellent
  <i>Tin</i> is said to be found in some parts of <i>Cornwall</i> at the
  Sides and in the Channels of running Waters, which they call ...; or
  whether the Ore be of a softer consistence, like <i>Earth</i> or
  <i>Lome</i>, as there is Lead-ore in <i>Ireland</i> holding store of
  Silver, and Iron-ore in the North parts of <i>Scotland</i> and elsewhere?
  And what is observable in it as to Weight, Colour, Mixture,
  <i>&amp;c</i>?</p>

  <p>50. Whether any part of the Metal be found in the Mine perfect and
  complete? (As I have had presented me good valuable <i>Copper</i>, and
  pieces of perfect <i>Lead</i>, that were taken up, the one at
  <i>Jamaica</i>, and the other by an acquaintance of mine, that took them
  out of the ground himself in <i>New England</i>.)</p>

  <p>51. Whether the Mine affords any parcels of Metal, that seem to grow
  like <i>Plants</i> (as I have sometimes seen Silver growing, as it
  seemed, out of Stone, or <i>Sparre</i> almost like blades of Grass; as
  also great Grains of a Metal, which appear'd to me, and which those, that
  tryed some of it, affirmed to be Gold, abounding in a stony lump, that
  seem'd to consist chiefly of a peculiar kind of <i>Sparre</i>.)</p>

  <p>52. Whether the Vein lie near, or much beneath the surface of the
  Earth, and at what depth?</p>

  <p>53. Whether the Vein have or have not any particular Concomitants, or
  Coats (if I may so call them;) and, if any, what they are, and in what
  order they lie? (As the Veins of <i>Lead-ore</i>, with us, have
  frequently annnext to them a Substance call'd <i>Sparre</i>, and next to
  that another, call'd <i>Caulk</i>.)</p>

  <p>54. Whether (besides these Coats) the Vein have belonging to it any
  other <i>Heterogeneous</i> substance? (As in <i>Tin-mines</i> we often
  find that yellow substance, which they call <i>Mundick</i>.)</p>

  <p>55. What are the principal Qualities of these Extraneous substances?
  (As that <i>Sparre </i> is white, but transparent, almost like course
  Crystall, heavy, britle, easily divisible into flakes, <i>&amp;c.</i>
  <i>Caulk</i> is of a different texture, white, opacous, and like a Stone,
  but much more ponderous. <i>Mundick</i> I have had of a fine golden
  colour; but, though it be affirm'd to hold no Metal; yet I found it in
  weight, and otherwise, to differ from <i>Marchasites</i>; and the
  Mine-men think it of a poisonous nature.) <!-- Page 338 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page338"></a>{338}</span></p>

  <p>56. Whether the Vein be inclosed every way in its Coats; or whether it
  only lye between them?</p>

  <p>57. Whether the Vein be every way of an uniform breadth, and
  thickness; and, if it be, what these Dimensions are; and if not, in what
  places it varies, and in what measures? (The like Questions are to be
  made concerning the <i>sparre</i>, <i>Caulk</i>, and other Teguments or
  mixtures of the Ore?)</p>

  <p>58. Whether the Vein be un-interrupted, or in some places broken off;
  and whether it be abruptly, or not; and whether it be by Vales, Brooks,
  Gullets, <i>&amp;c</i>?</p>

  <p>59. How wide the Interruptions are? what Signs, whereby to find the
  Vein again? whether the ulteriour part or division of the Vein be of the
  same Nature, and hold on in the same Course, as to its tendency upwards
  or downwards, or Horizontally, Norward, Southward, <i>&amp;c.</i> with
  the Vein, from which it is cut off?</p>

  <p>60. Whether, in case the last end of the Vein be found, it terminate
  abruptly, or else end in some peculiar kind of Rock or Earth, which does,
  as it were, close or Seal it up, without leaving any crack or cranny, or
  otherwise? And whether the terminating part of the Vein tend upwards,
  downwards, or neither? And whether in the places, where the Vein is
  interrupted, there be any peculiar Stone or Earth, that does, as it were,
  seal up the Extremity of it?</p>

  <p>61. Whether it be observed; that the Ore in Tract of time may be
  brought to afford any Silver or Gold, which it doth not afford, or more
  than it would afford, if it were not so ripe? And whether it have been
  found, that the Metalline part of the Vein grows so, that some part of
  the Mine will afford Ore or Metal in tract of time, that did not so
  before? And whether to this Maturation of the Mine, the being exposed to
  the free Air be necessary; or, whether at least it conduce to the
  Acceleration of it; or otherwise?</p>

  <p>62. Whether all the Ore, contained in the Mine, be of the self-same
  nature and goodness; and, if not, what are the differing kinds; and how
  to be discriminated and estimated?</p>

  <p>63. What is the fineness and goodness of the Ore, by which the Mine is
  wont to be estimated? And what are the marks and <!-- Page 339 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page339"></a>{339}</span>characters, that
  distinguish one sort from another?</p>

  <p>64. What proportion of Metal it affords? (As in our <i>Iron-mines</i>
  'tis observed, that about three Tuns of Iron-stone will afford one Tun of
  Metal: And I have had <i>Lead-Ore</i>, which an Ingenious man, to whom I
  recommended such Tryals, affirm'd to me to afford three parts in four of
  good Lead.)</p>

  <p>65. Whether the Ore be pure in its kind from other Metals, and, if
  not, of what Metals it participates; and in what proportion? Which is
  especially to be Inquired into, in case the Mine be of a <i>base</i>
  metal, that holds a <i>noble</i> metal: (As I have known it observ'd,
  that <i>Lead-Ore</i>, that is poor in its own metal; affords more Silver,
  than other; and I remember, that the <i>Ore</i> lately mention'd, being
  rich in Lead, scarce afforded us upon the <i>Cuppel</i>, an Atome of
  Silver. And <i>Matthesius</i> informs us, that a little Gold is not
  unfrequently found in <i>Iron-Ore</i>. And I have by me some Gold, that
  never endur'd the Fire, taken out of a Lump of Tin-Ore.)</p>

<h3><i>About the sixth Title.</i></h3>

  <p>66. What are the mechanick and prævious Operations, as Beating,
  Grinding, Washing, <i>&amp;c.</i> that are used to separate the Ore from
  the Heterogeneous Bodies, and prepare it for the Fire? Or whether the Ore
  requires no such preparation? (as it often happens in Lead, and sometimes
  in Iron, <i>&amp;c.</i>)</p>

  <p>67. Whether <i>Mercury</i> be made use off, to extract the nobler from
  the baser metals? (as is their practice in <i>Peru</i>, and other parts
  of the <i>West-Indies</i>.)</p>

  <p>68. Whether the leaving the Ore expos'd to the open Air and Rain for a
  good while, be used as a Præparative? (as I have seen done in
  <i>Iron-stone</i>.)</p>

  <p>69. Whether the Burning and Beating of the Ore be used to prepare it
  for the Furnace? (as is practised in <i>Iron</i>, and almost always in
  <i>Copper</i>:) And, in case they use it more than once, how often they
  do it; (for, <i>Copper-Ore</i> is in some places washed 8. or 10. times,
  and in others, 12. or 14.) and with what circumstances; as, how long the
  Ignition lasts at a time, whether the Ore be suffer'd to cool of it self,
  or be quench'd? whether it be washed betwixt each Ignition?</p>

  <p>70. What Flux-powders, and other ways they have to try <!-- Page 340
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page340"></a>{340}</span>and examine
  the goodness of the Ore in small quantities?</p>

  <p>71. Whether, when they work in <i>great</i>, they use to melt the Ore
  with any Flux or Additaments, or only by the force of the Fire, or in any
  way between both? (As throwing in of Charcoals when they melt Iron-stone
  does not only serve to feed the Fire, but perhaps by the <i>Alchaly</i>
  of its Ashes to promote the fusior: so Lime-stone, <i>&amp;c.</i>)</p>

  <p>72. What kind of Furnaces they use, to melt the Ore in? Whether they
  be all of one sort and bigness, or of differing?</p>

  <p>73. What are, the Situation, Materials, Dimensions, Shape, Bigness,
  and in short what is the whole structure and Contrivance of the Furnace?
  If there be any thing peculiar and remarkable? What Tools are used in
  Smelting, their Figures, use, <i>&amp;c.</i> And the whole manner of
  working?</p>

  <p>74. What kinds of Fewel, and what quantities of it, are wont to be
  employed in the Furnace, within the compass of a day, or week? How much
  is put in at a time? How often it is renewed? And how much Ore in a
  determinate time, as a week or a day, is wont to be reduced to Metal?</p>

  <p>75. In case an Additament be employed, what that is, and in what
  proportion it is added? Whether it be mingled with the Ore, before that
  be put into the Fire, or cast in afterwards; and, if so, at what time,
  <i>&amp;c</i>?</p>

  <p>78. Whether the Ore be melted by a Wind, excited by the Fire it self;
  as in Wind-ovens? Ore by the course of Waters? Or acuated by the blast of
  Bellows; and, if so, whether these Bellows be mov'd by a Wheel, turn'd by
  Water running under it, or falling on it? And what are, the Dimensions,
  Situation, <i>&amp;c.</i> of the Bellows?</p>

  <p>79. What contrivance they have, to let or take out the Metal, that is
  in fusion; and cast it into Barrs, Sows, Pigs, <i>&amp;c</i>?</p>

  <p>80. What Clay, Sand, or Mould they let it run or pour it through? And
  after what manner they refrigerate it?</p>

  <p>8l. Whether or no they do, either to facilitate the fusion, or to
  obtain the more or better Metal, mingle differing sorts or degrees of Ore
  of the same metal? (As in some places 'tis usual, to mingle poor and rich
  Ore; and at <i>Mendip</i> they mix two or more of these differing kinds
  of <i>Lead-ore</i> that they call <i>Frim-ore</i>, <i>Steel-ore</i>,
  <i>Potern-ore</i>, &amp;c.) <!-- Page 341 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page341"></a>{341}</span></p>

  <p>82. Whether or no, having once brought the Ore to fusion, they melt
  all the Metal it self, to have it the more pure? And, if they do, with
  what circumstances they make the fusion?</p>

  <p>83. Whether they have any Signs, whereby to know whether the Fusion
  have been well or ill perform'd; and the Metal have obtain'd the
  perfection, to be expected from such Ore, melted in such a Furnace?</p>

  <p>84. Whether they observe any great difference in the goodness of the
  Metal, that first melts, from that of the rest of the Metal which comes
  afterwards in the same or another operation? And whether the Rule holds
  constantly? (For, though they observe in <i>Tin-Mines</i>, the best Metal
  comes first, yet in the works of an Industrious friend of mine, he
  informs me, that the best Metal comes last.)</p>

  <p>85. Whether the produced Metal be all of the same goodness? And if it
  be, how good it is in reference to the Metal of other Mines, or other
  parts of the same Mine or Vein? And if it be not, what differences are
  observ'd between the produced portions of Metal; and what disparity that
  amounts to in the price?</p>

  <p>86. What are the Wayes of distinguishing them, and estimating their
  goodness?</p>

  <p>87. Whether they do any thing to the Metal, after it is once brought
  to Fusion, and, if need be, melt it over again, to give it a melioration?
  (As when <i>Iron</i> is refined, and turn'd into Steel;) And what
  distinct Furnaces, and peculiar Ways of ordering the Metals are employ'd
  to effect this improvement? With a full description of them and the Tools
  in all Circumstances, observ'd in the refining of Metals.</p>

  <p>88. Whether in those places, where the Metal is melted, there be not
  elevated some Corpuscles, that stick to the upper parts of the Furnace,
  or Building? And, if there be, whether they be barely fuliginous and
  recrementitious exhalations, or, at least in part, Metallin Flowers? (As
  in the <i>Cornish</i> Tin-mines, after some years they usually destroy
  the thatch'd Houses, where the Ore hath been melted, to get the stuff,
  that adhears to the insides of the Roofs, out of which they melt store of
  excellent Tin.)</p>

  <p>89. Whether the Metal, being brought to fusion, affords <!-- Page 342
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page342"></a>{342}</span>any
  Recrements? (As <i>Iron-stone</i> affords store of a dark Glass or Slagg)
  And, if it do, what those Recrements are? How they are separated from the
  Metal; and to what Uses they are employed?</p>

  <p>90. Whether, after the Metal has been once melted, the remaining part
  of the Ore being exposed to the Air, will in tract of time be
  impregnated, or ripen'd, so as to afford more Metal? (For, this is
  affirm'd to me of the <i>Cornish</i> Tin-Ore; and what remained after the
  fusion of <i>Iron-ore</i> in the <i>Forest of Dean</i>, is so rich in
  Metal, that a Tenant of mine in <i>Ireland</i>, though he had on the
  Land, he held from me, an Iron-Mine, found it less profit to work it,
  than to send cross the Sea to the <i>Forest of Dean</i> for this already
  us'd Ore, which having lain for some ages, since it was thrown aside in
  great heaps expos'd to the Air, he affirm'd to yield as well great great
  store of Iron, as very good: though I somewhat doubt, whether this be
  <i>totally</i> to be ascribed to the Aire, and length of time; or to the
  leaving of Metal in the Slaggs in old times, before great Furnaces were
  in use.)</p>

<h3><i>Promiscuous Inquiries about Mines, from the
same Author.</i></h3>

  <p>1. Whether the Territorie, that bears the Mine, abounds with no other
  Kind of Mineral in some distinct part of it? (As in <i>Kent</i> near
  <i>Tunbridge</i>, one part of the Country which is Hilly, abounds all
  along with <i>Iron-Mines</i>; the other, which is also Hilly, and divided
  from it but by a small Valley, abounds exceedingly (as the Diggers and
  Inhabitants told me upon the place) in <i>Quarry's</i>, which the
  Metallin-Country wants, but is quite destitute of Iron-stone. And so at
  <i>Mendip</i>, in one part of the Hill, I saw store of <i>Lead-Mines</i>,
  containing several Kinds of Ore of that Metal; another part of the Hill I
  found to be full of <i>Cole-pits</i>, which had some <i>Marchasites</i>,
  but no Metal; and in another place, <i>Iron-ore</i>, and <span
  class="correction" title="Original reads `mixt with Ores', corrected by errata, page 367."
  >mixt Ores,</span> which yet they did not think fit to work.)</p>

  <p>2. Whether the Air appear to be really cold in Summer, <!-- Page 343
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page343"></a>{343}</span>and hot in
  Winter at the bottom of the Mines, by surer proofs than the Testimony of
  our Touch?</p>

  <p>3. Whether they ever meet with places and Stones actually very hot, as
  <i>Matthesius</i> relates? And whether that spring not from the quenching
  of <i>Marchasites</i>?</p>

  <p>4. Whether they find in the Mines any Mineral Gelly, such as the
  <i>German</i> Naturalists call <i>Ghur</i>? And whether in process of
  time it will harden into a metal, or Mineral Concretion?</p>

  <p>5. What are the Laws, Constitutions, and Customs, <i>Oeconomical</i>,
  <i>Political</i>, <i>Ethical</i>, that are receiv'd and practis'd among
  the Mine-men?</p>

  <p>6. Whether the Diggers do ever really meet with any subterraneous
  <i>Demons</i>; and if they do, in what shape and manner they appear; what
  they portend; and what they do, <i>&amp;c</i>?</p>

  <p>7. Whether they observe in the Trees and other Plants, growing over or
  neer the Mine, not only, (as hath been already intimated) that the Leaves
  are any whit gilded or silver'd by the ascending Mineral Exhalations, but
  also, that the Trees or other Plants are more solid and ponderous? And if
  they have not also some discernable Metalline or Mineral Concretes, to be
  met within the small Cavities and Pores of their substance?</p>

  <p>8. Whether there be not Springs, and also greater Streams of Water
  neer the Mine, that rise, and run their whole course under ground,
  without ever appearing above it?</p>

  <p>9. Whether the Subterraneous Springs do rise with any wind or
  determinate change of weather?</p>

  <p>10. How much heavier the <i>Atmosphere</i> is at the bottom of the
  Mine, than at the top? And whether Damps considerably increase the weight
  of it?</p>

  <p>11. Whether they find any strange substances in the Mines, as Vessels,
  Anchors, Fishes inclos'd in Sparr or Metal, <i>&amp;c.</i>? <!-- Page 344

<h3><i></i>Promiscuous Inquiries<i>, chiefly about </i>Cold<i>, formerly
sent and recommended to Monsieur
</i>Heuelius<i>; together with his Answer return'd
to some of them.</i></h3>

  <p>A considerable piece of the grand Design of the Modern
  <i>Experimental</i> Philosophers being, to procure and accumulate
  Materials for a good Natural History, whence to raise in progress of time
  a solid Structure of Philosophy; all possible Endevours are used in
  <i>England</i>, to send abroad and recommend to as many of Forreign
  parts, as there is opportunity, <i>Directions</i> for searching into the
  Operations of Nature, and for observing what occurs therein, aswell as in
  Mechanical operations and practices.</p>

  <p>Several Heads of that kind have been already publish'd for this
  purpose in several of the former Tracts; to which, as we have added, in
  this, the <i>Quæries</i> about <i>Mines</i>, so we shall subjoyn those,
  that were not long since committed to the care of that Excellent Promoter
  of Astronomy and Philosophy, Monsieur <i>Heuelius</i>, Consul of
  <i>Dantzick</i>; who demonstrates so much zeal for the advancement of
  real knowledge, that he not only improves and promotes it by his own
  Studies, but labours also to incite others to do the like; having already
  warmed many of the Northern Climate, particularly <i>Poland</i>,
  <i>Prusse</i>, <i>Livonia</i>, <i>Sweden</i> and <i>Denmark</i>, into a
  disposition to be studious and active in inquiring after such particulars
  concerning Philosophy, as are recommended from hence, and rendred them,
  very willing to employ themselves in things of that nature.</p>

<h3><i>The Inquiries sent to </i>Dantzick<i>, are these;</i></h3>

  <p>1. What Signior <i>Burattini</i> (an <i>Italian</i> Gentleman, Master
  of the Mint to the King of <i>Poland</i>, and reputed a great Master in
  the <i>Mechanicks</i>) hath perform'd in <i>Diopticks</i>? Whether at
  present he employs himself, as is related, in grinding a <i>Telescope</i>
  of 120 foot long? And, if so, what way he means to make use <!-- Page 345
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page345"></a>{345}</span>of,
  commodiously to handle a Tube of that length?</p>

  <p>2. Whether the same have the Art (as has been written from
  <i>Paris</i>) to make such Glass, as is not at all inferiour to
  <i>Venice</i>-glass, and exceeds any plate of Glass, hitherto made there,
  twice or thrice in bigness?</p>

  <p>3. What is the way of making Pot-ashes in <i>Poland</i>?</p>

  <p>4. What is to be observed about <i>Succinum</i> or Amber? whether it
  be an Exsudation of the Sea? whether it be seen to float upon the surface
  of the Sea? whether it be soft, when 'tis first cast on shore? At what
  season of the year, and in what manner 'tis taken up, <i>&amp;c</i>?</p>

  <p>5. What is to be observ'd in the Digging of <i>Sal Gemmæ</i> in
  <i>Poland</i>? what is the Depth of the Mines, stored with this Salt?
  what their distance from the Sea, <i>&amp;c</i>?</p>

  <p>6. What truth there is in that Relation concerning Swallows being
  found in Winter under waters congealed, and reviving, if they be fish'd
  and held to the fire?</p>

  <p>7. Whether there be in the <i>Bodnick Bay</i> a Whirl-pool, as is
  related to be in the Sea of <i>Norway</i>, which is commonly call'd the
  <i>Maal-stroom</i>? And whether there be any Signs, that speak the
  communication of those Gulphs by subterraneous passages; as the Jesuit
  <i>Kircher</i> affirms in his <i>Mundus Subterraneus</i> T. 1. p.
  146?</p>

  <p>8. To what depth the Cold in those parts peirces the Earth and
  Water?</p>

  <p>9. Whether their Watches go slower by the intense cold?</p>

  <p>10. Whether their Oyls in hard frosts are turn'd into true, that is,
  hard and britle, Ice?</p>

  <p>11. Whether they can freeze there a strong Brine of Bay-Salt; and a
  strong Decoction of <i>Sal Gemmæ</i>, or Soot; or a strong Solution of
  <i>Salt</i> of <i>Tartar</i>, or of <i>Sugar</i> of <i>Lead</i>?</p>

  <p>12. Whether they can congeal meer <i>Blood</i>, all the serous part
  thereof being sever'd? Item, <i>Canary</i> Wine; the <i>Lixiviums</i> of
  Soap-boylers, and such as are prepared of other Salts; as also, the
  Spirits extracted out of Salts, as Spirit of <i>Vitriol</i>,
  <i>Nitre</i>, &amp;c?</p>

  <p>13. Whether an intense and lasting Frost makes any alteration in
  <i>Quick-silver</i>, exposed very shallow in a flat Vessel.</p>

  <p>14. Whether the Purgative virtue of <i>Catharticks</i> be increased or
  lessened, or even totally destroy'd by a strong and continued Cold? <!--
  Page 346 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page346"></a>{346}</span></p>

  <p>15. Whether Harts-horn thaw'd, and such like substances, using the
  same method of Distilling, yield the same quantity of Liquor, which they
  use to yield, when not frozen?</p>

  <p>16. What Cold operates in the Fermentation of Liquors?</p>

  <p>17. Whether Birds and Wilde Beasts grow white there in Winter, and
  recover their native colour in Summer?</p>

  <p>18. Whether Colours may be concentred by a sharp cold? <i>E.g.</i> A
  strong Decoction of Cocheneel in a fit Glass?</p>

  <p>19. Whether the <i>Electrical</i> virtue of <i>Amber</i>, and the
  <i>Attractive</i> and <i>Directive</i> force of the <i>Magnet</i>, be
  changed by a vehement Cold?</p>

  <p>20. Whether pieces of Iron and Steel, even thick ones, be made britle
  by intense frosts; and therefore Smiths are obliged for prevention, to
  give their Iron and Steel-tools a softer temper?</p>

  <p>21. Whether accurate Observations evince, that all Fishes dye in
  frozen Waters, if the Ice be not broken? Where it is to be diligently
  inquired into, whether the Cold it self, or the want of changing or
  ventilating the water, or the privation of Air, be the cause of the death
  of Fishes?</p>

  <p>22. Whether any Physicians or Anatomists have inquired, by freezing to
  death some Animals (as Rabits, Pullets, Dogs, Cats, &amp;c.) after what
  manner it is, that Intense Cold kills men? whether they have found any
  Ice in the Inner parts; and if so, in which of them; Whether in the
  Ventricles of the Brain and Heart; and in the greater Vessels?</p>

  <p><i>These were the Queries</i> recommended about a Twelve-month ago.
  Monsieur <i>Heuelius</i> in a late Letter of his, accompanied with
  several papers from others, returns this Accompt.</p>

  <p>The Inquiries you proposed to me, I did impart to several of my
  Learned friends: But hitherto I have attained an Answer but to few
  particulars. Among the rest you'l find a Letter of the Learned
  <i>Johannes Schefferus</i>, Professor in the <i>Swedish</i> University at
  <i>Vpsall</i>, wherein he discourses handsomly of several things, being
  ready to entertain a Literary Commerce with you about such matters.
  Touching <i>Amber</i>, I am almost of the same mind with him, that it is
  a kind of <i>Fossil Pitch</i> or <i>Bitumen</i>, seeing it is not only
  found on the Shore of the <i>Borussian</i> Sea, but also digg'd up in
  subterraneous places, some <i>German</i> miles distant from the <!-- Page
  347 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page347"></a>{347}</span>and that
  not only in Sandy, but also in other Hills of firmer Earth; of which I
  have seen my self pretty big pieces. Concerning <i>Swallows</i>, I have
  frequently heard Fisher-men affirm, that they have here often fish'd them
  out of the Lakes, in the Winter; but I never have seen it my self. Whilst
  I am writing this, I receive Letters out of <i>Denmark</i>, advertising
  me, that those two Learned men, <i>Thomas</i> and <i>Erasmus
  Bartholin</i>, do intend shortly to answer the same <i>Quæries</i>. Next
  Winter, if God vouchsafe me life and health, I purpose to make a Journey
  to <i>Konigs-berg</i>, where I hope to learn many things, especially
  about <i>Amber</i>.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p><i>Thus far in answer to those Inquiries for the present.</i></p>

</blockquote>

  <p>To this he subjoyns other things, no less fit to be communicated to
  the Curious, in these words;</p>

  <p>The Books you have sent me over sea, I have not yet received: I wish,
  they were all translated into Latin; for I have not <i>English</i>
  enough, to understand all particulars perfectly. For the rest, you have
  obliged me, by communicating the Observations of the last <i>Eclipse</i>
  of the <i>Sun</i>, aswell those made in <i>England</i>, as those of
  <i>Paris</i> and <i>Madrid</i>. That I may requite you in some measure, I
  send you my Observations both of <i>that</i>, and the <i>Moons</i> last
  <i>Eclipse</i>. In the <i>Sun's Eclipse</i>, this is chiefly observable,
  That the <i>Semidiameter</i> of the <i>Moon</i> from the very beginning,
  to about 5. or 6. digits of the increasing <i>Phasis</i> was much less
  than the <i>Rudolphin</i> Account imports. For it was then almost equal
  to the <i>Semidiameter</i> of the <i>Sun</i>: but, after the greatest
  Obscuration, when I again contemplated the <i>Moons Semidiameter</i>, I
  found it 8&Prime; or 9&Prime; bigger than that of the <i>Sun</i>; so that
  the <i>Semidiameter</i> of the <i>Moon</i> was not always, during this
  Eclipse, constant to it self. It will therefore be worth while, to be
  hereafter more diligent and curious in this particular, and accurately to
  observe in the <i>Phasis</i> of each <i>Digit</i> the <i>Proportion</i>
  of the <i>Semidiameters</i> of both Luminaries; to the end, that
  <i>first</i> it may be made manifest, Whether in all the <i>Eclipses</i>
  of the <i>Sun</i>, or in some only, that variation happens; <i>next</i>,
  that the Causes of such a <i>Phænomenon</i> may be diligently inquired
  into. Of this Variation, the Excellent <i>Ismael Bullialdus</i> hath also
  observed something at <i>Paris</i>. For he has written to me, That in the
  same Eclipse the <i>Semidiam.</i> of the <i>Sun</i> to the <i>Semid.</i>
  of the <i>Moon</i> was, as 16&prime;. 9&Prime;. to 16&prime;. 22&Prime;;
  but that in another <!-- Page 348 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page348"></a>{348}</span><i>Phasis</i> of 6 <i>digits</i>, the
  Semidiameters appear'd equal. These my Observations, if you think them
  worthy, you may communicate to other Mathematicians. The last year 1665.
  <i>July</i> 27. (<i>st. n.</i>) the <i>Tables</i> did also indicate an
  Eclipse of the <i>Moon</i>: but though the Sky here was very cleer, yet
  the Moon was not at all obscured by the <i>true shadow</i>, but entred
  only a little into the <i>Penumbra</i>, wherein it continued 50&prime;.
  The beginning of its touching the <i>Penumbra</i> did then almost happen,
  when <i>Aquila</i> was elevated 36° 18&prime;; which is an Example worthy
  to be noted. I have many Observations of the <i>Eclipses</i> of former
  years by me, which I could not yet make publick, by reason of the
  multitude of my business, which do almost over-whelm me. The Eclipse of
  the Moon of this Year 1666. <i>June</i> 16. (<i>st. n.</i>) was observed
  from a Hill neer my Garden, to the end, that we might see both together
  the <i>Suns setting</i>, and the <i>Moon rising</i>. But I was
  disappointed of my hopes: For very thick Exhalations, besieging the
  <i>Horizon</i>, where the Moon was to rise, unto 2°. 30&prime;, hindred
  me from seeing the <i>Moon rise</i>, in the Article of the <i>setting</i>
  of the <i>Sun</i>. Wherefore the first <i>Phasis</i> of 1. <i>dig</i>.
  45&prime;. did not appear but in the <i>Moons Altitude</i> of 2°.
  30&prime;; when the greatest Obscuration was already past. The <i>End</i>
  fell out hor. 9. 27&prime;. about 128° from the <i>Zenith</i>
  Westward.</p>

  <p>I am very glad to understand, that you have so good <i>Telescopes</i>,
  as to make such considerable Observations in <i>Jupiter</i> and
  <i>Mars</i>, as you have lately done in <i>England</i>. I have no leasure
  now, by reason of the Observations of the Fixt Stars, which I now almost
  constantly am employ'd about, to do any thing in the advancing of
  <i>Telescopes</i>. I am obliged to finish the <i>Catalogue</i> of the
  <i>Fixt Stars</i>; having mean while the contentment to find, that many
  excellent persons labour about the Improvement of <i>Optick Glasses</i>.
  If I could get a good one of those of 60. foot, you mention, at a
  reasonable rate, you would oblige me in sending me one; perhaps may I be
  so happy, as to make likewise some good discovery or other, by the help
  thereof. In the mean time, let me know, I pray, the Dimensions of those
  Glasses, and how they are to be managed. The ingenious <i>Burattini</i>
  has not yet finisht his <i>Telescope</i>; as soon <!-- Page 349 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page349"></a>{349}</span><span
  class="sidenoter">* A Letter, written since from <i>Paris</i>,
  advertises, that some of the Curious there have received one of these
  Glasses of <i>Sr. Burattini</i>, and do esteem it to be good without
  mentioning the Dimension of it: which yet is look'd for by the
  next.</span> as he hath, I shall acquaint you with it. * Before I
  conclude, I must give notice to the Lovers of <i>Astronomy</i>, that on
  the 24. of <i>September</i> (st. n) of this year, I have observ'd that
  <i>New Star</i> in <i>Pectore Cygni</i> (which from the year 1662. untill
  this time hath been almost altogether hid) not only with my naked Eye,
  like a Star of the sixth or seventh Magnitude, but also with a very great
  <i>Sextant</i>. It is still in the very same place of the Heavens, where
  it was formerly from <i>A.</i> 1601. to almost 1662. For, its Distance
  from <i>Scheat Pegasi</i> hath been by me found 35°. 51&prime;.
  20&Prime;. and from <i>Marcab</i>, 43°. 10&prime;. 50&Prime;; which
  Distances (as I have found in my <i>Journal</i>) are altogether equal to
  those, which I observ'd <i>A.</i> 1658. the 1. of <i>November</i>. For
  the Distance from <i>Scheat</i> at that time was 35°. 51&prime;.
  20&Prime;. and from <i>Marcab</i>, 43°. 10&prime;. 25&Prime;: where that
  former from <i>Scheat</i> exactly answers to the recent; and that from
  <i>Marcab</i>, 'tis true, differs in a very few <i>Seconds</i>, but that
  disparity is of no moment, since it only proceeded from thence, that this
  <i>New Star</i> is not yet so distinctly to be seen, as at that time,
  when it was of the <i>third Magnitude</i>. It is therefore certain, that
  it is the self same Star, which <i>Kepler</i> did first see <i>A.</i>
  1601. and continued untill <i>A.</i> 1662. But whether in time it will
  grow bigger and bigger, or be lost again, time will shew. He that will
  observe this Star, must take care, lest he mistake those three more
  <i>Southern</i> ones, of the <i>Sixth Magnitude</i>, and now in a manner
  somewhat brighter (though not extant on the <i>Globe</i>) than the <i>New
  Star</i> in <i>Collo Cygni</i>. The highest of those three, is distant
  from <i>Scheat Pegasi</i> 36°. 25&prime;. 45&Prime;; the middlemost from
  the same, 37°. 25&prime;. 20&Prime;. and the lowest, 38°. 4&prime;.
  30&Prime;. Farewell, and assure the Most Illustrious <i>Royal Society</i>
  of my humblest Services.</p>

  <p><i>So far Monsieur Heuelius</i>, whose accurate Calcul. of the
  <i>Solar Eclipses</i> Duration, Quantity, <i>&amp;c.</i> is intended to
  be fully represented the next Month, since it could not be conveniently
  done this time. The <i>annexed</i> Papers follow.</p>

  <p><i>One</i> is from Monsieur <i>Joh. Schefferus</i>, to this
  purpose.</p>

  <p>1. That he is confident, the <i>Royal Society</i> of <i>England</i>
  will do much good for the advancement of usefull Knowledge.</p>

<p><!-- Page 350 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page350"></a>{350}</span></p>

  <p>2. That he conceives <i>Amber</i> to be a kind of <i>Fossil Pitch</i>,
  whole Veins lie at the bottom of the Sea; believing that it is hardned in
  tract of time, and by the motion of the Sea cast on shore: <i>He
  adds</i>, that hitherto it hath been believed, not to be found but in
  <i>Borussia</i>; but he assures, that it is also found in <i>Sueden</i>,
  on the shores of the Isle <i>Biorkóó</i>, in the Lake <i>Melero</i>,
  whose water is <i>sweet</i>. Of this, <i>he saith</i>, he hath a fine
  piece by him, two inches large and thick, presented him by one, that
  himself with his own hands had gathered it and several other pieces, on
  the shore of the said Island; affirming withall from the mouth of a
  Shepherd of that place, that it is thrown out by a strong Wind, bearing
  upon the shore.</p>

  <p>3. That it is most certain, that <i>Swallows</i> sink themselves
  towards Autumne into Lakes, no otherwise than <i>Frogs</i>; and that many
  have assured him of it, who had seen them drawn out with a Net together
  with Fishes, and put to the fire, and thereby revived.</p>

  <p>4. That 'tis also very true, that many <i>Animals</i> there grow white
  in Winter, and recover their own Colour in Summer. That himself hath seen
  and had <i>Hares</i>, which about the beginning of Winter and Spring were
  half white, and half of their native colour: that in the midst of winter
  he never saw any but all white. That <i>Foxes</i> also are white in
  Winter; and <i>Squirrels</i> grayish, mixt of dark and white colour.</p>

  <p>5. That 'tis known there generally, that <i>Fishes</i> are killed, by
  reason of the Ice not being broken: but <i>first</i>, in ponds only or
  narrow Lakes; <i>next</i>, in such Lakes only, where the Ice is pretty
  thick; for, where 'tis thin, they dye not so easily. <i>Lastly</i>, that
  those Fishes that lie in slimy or clayie ground, dye not so soon as
  others. But, <i>he adds</i>, that even in great Lakes, when 'tis a very
  bitter Frost, Ice is wont to be broken, either by the force of the Waves,
  or of the Imprisoned Vapors, raised by the agitation of the Water, and
  then bursting out with an impetuosity; witness the noise made by the
  rupture of the Ice through the whole length of such Lakes, which <i>he
  affirms</i> to be not less terrible than if many guns went off together.
  Whereby it falls out, that Fishes are seldom found dead in great
  Lakes.</p>

  <p>6. That neither Oyle, nor a strong Brine of Bay-Salt, is truly <!--
  Page 351 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page351"></a>{351}</span>congeal'd into Ice, in those parts,
  <i>Viz.</i> at <i>Upsall</i> in <i>Sueden</i>.</p>

  <p>7. That the Frost pierces into the Earth, two Cubits or <i>Swedish</i>
  Ells; and what moisture is found in it, is white, like Ice: That Waters,
  if standing, freeze to a greater depth, even to three such Ells or more;
  but those that have a Current, less: That rapid Rivers freeze not at all;
  nor ever-bubling Springs; and that these latter seem even to be warmer in
  Winter, than Summer.</p>

  <p><i>So far this Observer</i>; who likewise offers his Services in
  giving an answer to the remaining <i>Queries</i>, and in entertaining a
  commerce in such other Philosophical matters, as he is conversant in.</p>

  <p><i>Another</i> Paper written by Monsieur <i>Febre</i>, chief Secretary
  to Prince <i>Ratzivil</i>, contains these particulars;</p>

  <p>1. That the College of the Learned in <i>Borussia</i>, finds it not so
  easie to resolve all those <i>Queries</i> sent from <i>England</i> to M.
  <i>Heuelius:</i> but yet that they will try what may be done upon it.</p>

  <p>2. That as for himself, he can assure from his own Experience
  concerning the Effects of Cold; <i>First</i>, That in the War against the
  <i>Muscovites</i> and <i>Cosacks</i>, <i>A.</i> 1655. in <i>January</i>,
  in <i>White Russia</i>, at the Siege of <i>Biskow</i>, 30. Leagues from
  <i>Smolensko</i>, and three from <i>Morhilo</i>, near the River
  <i>Boristhenes</i>, when they had Quarter in a Village call'd
  <i>Bikau</i>, they were seized on with such a Frost, that all their
  Provisions of <i>Spanish</i> Wines or <i>Petersimen</i>, and
  <i>Beere</i>, were in one Night frozen upon the Sleds, notwithstanding
  they were cover'd with Straw; in so much, that when next morning they
  would have drawn of those Liquors, they found all dry, and were
  constrain'd to carry them into a Stove, to thaw them; which they could
  not do in two whole days, and were obliged to break the Vessels, and put
  pieces of the Icy Wine into Kettles to thaw them over the Fire, for
  Drink: That they asked not for a Draught, but a <i>Morsel</i> of Wine or
  Beer: That their Horses had no better cheer than themselves, as to matter
  of Drink; the Pond of the Village being so thoroughly frozen, that there
  was but very little Water left between the Ice and the bottom of the
  Pool; whereby the poor Beasts were forced to drink with great reverence,
  kneeling on the forefeet to thrust their heads into the holes, made for
  them in the Ice, and to suck thence some drops of Water; and that, if
  they had not had Snow to eat, there would have dyed a far greater <!--
  Page 352 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page352"></a>{352}</span>number of them, than there did. Moreover,
  that he observed, that the <i>Hungarian Wine</i>, of which they had a
  Tun, resisted the Cold better, than the <i>Peter Simen</i>; for it was
  not so much frozen; unless it be, that the Butler had more care of that,
  than the rest, by transporting it sooner into the Stove, when he found
  the excess of Cold. Again, that one presenting him in the March with some
  <i>Aqua-vitæ</i>, the Scrue of the Flagon, put to his Mouth, stuck so
  close to his Lips, that he could not draw it off, without drawing
  bloud,</p>

  <p>In a <i>third</i> Paper, I find these particulars from the same M.
  <i>Febre</i>.</p>

  <p>1. That a considerable person, one Dr. <i>Becker</i>, a great Lover of
  Curious Inquiries, has given him hopes to entertain this Philosophical
  Commerce.</p>

  <p>2. That he hath seen men dye in <i>Poland</i> and <i>Lithuania</i>
  both of <i>Heat</i> and <i>Cold</i>. And <i>first</i>, that <i>A.</i>
  1653. in <i>July</i>, being with this present King of <i>Poland</i> in
  march from <i>Leopoli</i> to the Camp of <i>Glignani</i>, it was so
  furiously hot that day of their march, that it caused such an alteration
  in that Regiment of Foot, which was the Kings Guard, marching most of
  them bare-foot upon Sands, that more than an hundred of them fell down
  altogether disabled, whereof a dozen dyed out-right, without any other
  Sickness. <i>Secondly</i>, as to the Cold, that the frost was so bitter,
  that 3 Souldiers dyed of it, <i>A.</i> 1665. the 2. of <i>January</i>, in
  passing a long Ditch: besides, that divers persons lost some of their
  Lims.</p>

<h3>The Method observed in <i>Transfusing the
Bloud of one Animal into another.</i></h3>

  <p>This Method was promised in the last of these Papers. It was first
  practiced by Dr. <i>Lower</i> in <i>Oxford</i>, and by him communicated
  to the Honourable <i>Robert Boyl</i>, who imparted it to the <i>Royal
  Society</i>, as follows;</p>

  <p>First, Take up the <i>Carotidal</i> Artery of the Dog or other Animal,
  whose Bloud is to be transfused into another of the <!-- Page 354
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page354"></a>{354}</span>same or a
  different kind, and separate it from the Nerve of the <i>Eighth pair</i>,
  and lay it bare above an inch. Then make a strong Ligature on the
  <i>upper</i> part of the Arterie, not to be untied again: but an inch
  below, <i>videl.</i> towards the Heart, make another Ligature of a
  <i>running</i> knot, which may be loosen'd or fastned as there shall be
  occasion. Having made these two knots, draw two threds under the Artery
  between the Ligatures; and then open the Artery, and put in a Quil, and
  tie the Artery upon the Quill very fast by those two threds, and stop the
  Quill with a stick. After this, make bare the <i>Jugular</i> Vein in the
  other Dog about an inch and a half long; and at each end make a Ligature
  with a running knot, and in the space betwixt the two running knots drawn
  under the Vein two threds, as in the other: then make an Incision in the
  Vein, and put into it two Quills, one into the <i>descendent</i> part of
  the Vein, to receive the bloud from the other Dog and carry it to the
  Heart; and the other Quill put into the other part of the <i>Jugular</i>
  Vein, which comes from the Head (out of which, the second Dogs own bloud
  must run into Dishes.) These two Quills being put in and tied fast, stop
  them with a stick, till there be occasion to open them.</p>

  <p>All things being thus prepar'd, the Dogs on their sides towards one
  another so conveniently, that the Quill may go into each other, (for the
  Dogs necks cannot be brought so near, but that you must put two or three
  several Quills more into the first two, to convey the bloud from one to
  another.) After that unstop the Quill that goes down into the first Dog's
  <i>Jugular</i> Vein, and the other Quill coming out of the other Dog's
  Artery; and by the help of two or three other Quills, put into each
  other, according as there shall be occasion, insert them into one
  another. Then flip the running knots, and immediatly the bloud runs
  through the Quills, as through an Artery, very impetuosly. And
  immediately, as the bloud runs into the Dog, unstop the other Quill,
  coming out of the <i>upper</i> part of his <i>Jugular</i> Vein (a
  Ligature being first made about his Neck, or else his other
  <i>Jugular</i> Vein being compress'd by ones Finger;) and let his own
  bloud run out at the same time into Dishes (yet not constantly, but
  according as you perceive him able to bear it) <!-- Page 355 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page355"></a>{355}</span>till the other Dog
  begin to cry, and faint, and fall into Convulsions, and at last dye by
  his side.</p>

  <p>Then take out both the Quills out of the Dogs <i>Jugular</i> Vein, and
  tye the running knot fast, and cut the Vein asunder, (which you may doe
  without any harm to the Dog, one <i>Jugular</i> Vein being sufficient to
  convey all the bloud from the Head and upper parts, by reason of a large
  <i>Anatomosis</i>, whereby both the <i>Jugular</i> Veins meet about the
  <i>Larinx</i>.) This done, sow up the skin and dis-miss him, and the Dog
  will leap from the Table and shake himself and run away, as if nothing
  ailed him.</p>

  <p>And this I have tryed several times, before several in the
  <i>Universities</i>, but never yet upon more than one Dog at a time, for
  want of leisure, and convenient supplyes of several Dogs at once. But
  when I return, I doubt not but to give you a fuller account, not only by
  bleeding several Dogs into one, but several other creatures into one
  another, as you did propose to me, before you left <i>Oxford</i>; which
  will be very easie to perform; and will afford many pleasant and perhaps
  not unuseful Experiments.</p>

  <p>But because there are many Circumstances necessary to be observ'd in
  the performing of this Experiment, and that you may better direct any one
  to doe it, without any danger of killing the other Dog, that is to
  receive the others bloud, I will mention two or three.</p>

  <p><i>First</i>, that you fasten the Dogs at such a convenient distance,
  that the Vein nor Artery be not stretched; for then, being contracted,
  they will not admit or convey so much bloud.</p>

  <p><i>Secondly</i>, that you constantly observe the Pulse beyond the
  Quill in the Dogs <i>Jugular</i> Vein (which it acquires from the impulse
  of the <i>Arterious</i> bloud:) For if that fails, then 'tis a sign the
  Quil is stopt by some congealed bloud, so that you must draw out the
  <i>Arterial</i> Quill from the other, and with a <i>Probe</i> open the
  passage again in both of them, that the bloud may have its free course
  again. For, this must be expected, when the Dog, that bleeds into the
  other, hath lost much bloud, his heart will beat very faintly, and then
  the impulse <!-- Page 356 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page356"></a>{356}</span>of bloud being weaker, it will be apt to
  congeal the sooner, so that at the latter end of the work you must draw
  out the Quill ofter, and clear the passage; if the Dog be faint-hearted,
  as many are, though some stout fierce Dogs will bleed freely and
  uninterruptedly, till they are convuls'd and dye. But to prevent this
  trouble, and make the experiment certain, you must bleed a great Dog into
  a little one, or a <i>Mastive</i> into a <i>Curr</i>, as I once try'd,
  and the little Dog bled out at least double the quantity of his own
  bloud, and left the <i>Mastive</i> dead upon the Table, and after he was
  untyed, he ran away and shak'd himself, as if he had been only thrown
  into water. Or else you may get three or four several Dogs prepared in
  the same manner; and when one begins to fail and leave off bleeding,
  administer another, and I am confident one Dog will receive all their
  bloud, (and perhaps more) as long as it runs freely, till they are left
  almost dead by turns: provided that you let out the bloud proportionably,
  as you let it goe into the Dog, that is to live.</p>

  <p><i>Thirdly</i>, I suppose the Dog that is to bleed out into dishes
  will endure it the better, if the Dogs that are to be administred to
  supply his bloud, be of near an equal age, and fed alike the day before,
  that both their blouds may be of a neer strength and temper.</p>

  <p>There are many things I have observed upon bleeding Dogs to death,
  which I have seen since your departure from <i>Oxford</i>, whereof I
  shall give you a relation hereafter; in the mean time since you were
  pleased to mention it to the <i>Royal Society</i>, with a promise to give
  them an account of this experiment, I could not but take the first
  opportunity to clear you from that obligation, &amp;c.</p>

  <p><i>So far this Letter;</i> the prescriptions whereof having been
  carefully observ'd by those who were imployed to make the Experiment,
  have hitherto been attended with good success; and that not only upon
  Animals of the same <i>Species</i> (as two Dogs first, and then two
  Sheep) but also upon some of very differing <i>Species</i> (as a Sheep
  and a Dog; the former <i>Emitting</i>, the other <i>Receiving</i>)</p>

  <p><i>Note</i> only, that instead of a Quill, a small crooked thin <!--
  Page 357 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page357"></a>{357}</span>Pipe
  of Silver or Brass, so slender that the one end may enter into a Quill,
  and having at the other end, that is to enter into the Vein and Arterie,
  a small knob, for the better fastening them to it with a thread, will be
  much fitter than a strait Pipe or Quill, for this Operation: for so they
  are much more easie to be managed.</p>

  <p>'Tis intended, that these tryals shall be prosecuted to the utmost
  variety the subject will bear: As by exchanging the bloud of Old and
  Young, Sick and Healthy, Hot and Cold, Fierce and Fearful, Lame and Wild
  Animals, &amp;c., and, that not only the same, but also of differing
  kinds. For which end, and to improve this noble Experiment, either for
  knowledge, or use, or both, some Ingenious men have already proposed
  considerable tryals and Inquiries; of which perhaps an account will be
  given hereafter. For the present we shall only subjoyn some.</p>

<h3><i>Considerations about this kind of Experiments.</i></h3>

  <p>1. It may be consider'd in them, that the bloud of the <i>Emittent</i>
  Animal, may after a few minuts of time, by its circulation, mix and run
  out with that of the <i>Recipient</i>. Wherefore to be assured in these
  Tryals, that all the bloud of the <i>Recipient</i> is run out, and none
  left in him but the adventitious bloud of the <i>Emittent</i>, two or
  three or more Animals (which was also hinted in the <i>method</i> above)
  may be prepared and administred, to bleed them all out into one.</p>

  <p>2. It seems not irrational to guess afore hand, that the exchange of
  bloud will not alter the nature or disposition of the Animals, upon which
  it shall be practised; though it may be thought worth while for
  satisfaction and certainty, to determine that point by Experiments. The
  case of exchanging the bloud of Animals seems not like that of
  <i>Graffing</i>, where the <i>Cyons</i> turns the Sap of the
  <i>Stock</i>, graffed upon, into its nature; the <i>Fibres</i> of the
  Cyons so straining the juice, which passes from the stem to it, as
  thereby to change it into that of the Cyons, whereas in this transfusion
  there seems to be no such <!-- Page 358 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page358"></a>{358}</span>Percolation of the bloud of Animals,
  whereby that of the one should be changed into the nature of the
  other.</p>

  <p>3. The most probable use of this Experiment may be conjectured to be
  that one Animal may live with the bloud of another; and consequently,
  that those Animals, that want bloud, or have corrupt bloud, may be
  supplyed from other with a sufficient quantity, and of such as is good,
  provided the Transfusion be often repeated, by reason of the quick
  expence that is made of the bloud.</p>

<h3>Note.</h3>

  <p><i>In the last </i>Transactions<i> was also promised an Accompt by the
  next, of Monsieur </i>Hevelius<i> his accurate Calcul. of the late
  </i>Solar Eclipses<i>, Duration, Quantity, &amp;c. But this being to be
  accompanyed with </i>Scheme<i>, the </i>Graving<i> whereof met with a
  disappointment, it must be still referred to another Opportunity.</i></p>

<hr class="short" />

<h3><i>An Accompt of some Sanative-waters in
</i>Herefordshire<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>This account was communicated by Dr. <i>B.</i> in these words.</p>

  <p>There are two Springs in <i>Herefordshire</i>, whereof one is within a
  Bolt, or at least Bow-shoot of the top of the near adjoyning loftie Hill
  of <i>Malvern</i>, and at great distance from the Foot of the Hill; and
  hath had a long and old fame for healing of eyes. When I was for some
  years molested with Tetters on the back of one and sometimes of both my
  hands, notwithstanding all endeavors of my very friendly and skilful
  Physitians I had speedy healing from a neighbouring Spring of far less
  fame. Yet this Spring healed very old and Ulcerous sores on the Legs of a
  poor Fellow, which had been poyson'd by Irons in the Gaol, after other
  Chirurgery had been hopeless. And by many tryals upon my hands, and the
  Tetters; I was perswaded, that in long droughts, and lasting dry Frosts,
  those waters were more effectually and more speedily healing, than at
  other times. And not to omit this circumstance, I did hold this water in
  my mouth, till it was warm, perchance somewhat intermingled with fasting
  Spittle, <!-- Page 359 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page359"></a>{359}</span>and so dropping it upon the Tetter, I
  there could see it immediately gather a very thin skin upon the raw
  flesh, not unlike that which is seen to gather upon Milk over a gentle
  fire. This skin would have small holes in it, through which a moisture
  did issue in small drops, which being wip'd away, and the water continued
  to be dropp'd warm out of the mouth, the holes would diminish, and at
  last be all quite healed up.</p>

  <p>For the <i>Eye-waters</i>, I conceived them more strongly tersive, and
  clearing the Eyes; and they had a rough smartness, as if they carryed
  Sand or Gravel into the Eye.</p>

  <p>I have known and try'd three or four healing Fountains of late
  discovery, or of no old fame that I could hear of.</p>

  <p>I did once put rich <i>Marle</i> for some days in a vessel of water,
  to try whether the water would acquire a healing vertue, but my
  Experiments were interrupted. I had in my thoughts many other ways of
  Tryal; which I may resume hereafter.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<h3><i>A farther Accompt of the </i>Vitriolate-water<i>,
mention'd </i>Num. 18 p. <a href="#page323">323</a><i>. Together with
some other particulars touching waters.</i></h3>

  <p>This comes from the same hand as follows;</p>

  <p>I formerly mentioned to you, that, if that Pool of Mr.
  <i>Phillip's</i>, which seems to be of Vitriolate-water, were on my
  ground, I would drain it, and search the head of the Spring, pursuing the
  source, till I could well discern, through what lay of Earth or Gravel it
  does pass. Now I shall tell you, that I have taken order for the further
  tryal of the said Water, by boiling a greater quantity in a Furnace,
  &amp;c. But just as we were in readiness for the tryal, a stream of
  Rain-water fell into the Pool, and so discourag'd us for the present. I
  have also taken a course to turn the falling Waters aside, and to drain
  the Pool, that we may see, what the Native Springs (whether one or more)
  may be. Of which more hereafter.</p>

  <p>I wish (<i>so he goes on</i>) we had a full Accompt of our
  <i>Salt-Springs</i> at <i>Droyt-wych</i> near <i>Worcester</i>, and at
  <i>Nant-wych</i> in <i>Cheshire</i> (what other Salt-Springs we have in
  <i>England</i>, I know not:) <!-- Page 360 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page360"></a>{360}</span>It should be inquired, at what distance
  they are from the Seas, or from Salt-fluxes, from Hills, and how deep in
  the Vales? What the weight? Whether in droughts or long Frosts the
  proportion of Salt or weight increaseth? Whether the Earth near the
  Springs, or in their passage hath any peculiar ferment, or produceth a
  blackishness, if it rests, after it is well drained.</p>

<h3><i>Inquiries for </i>Turky<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>Though many Relations and Descriptions of <i>Turky</i> be extant in
  Print, yet they leave in many a desire of a fuller information in the
  following particulars, lately drawn up, for the most part by Mr.
  <i>H.</i> and recommended to an Ingenious Gentleman, bound for that
  Country; and desired also to be taken notice of by others, that may have
  occasion to visit the same.</p>

  <p>2. Whether the <i>Turks</i> do not only take <i>Opium</i> themselves
  for strength and courage, but also give it to their Horses, Camels and
  Dromedaries, for the same purpose, when they find them tired and faint in
  their travelling? What is the greatest <i>Dose</i>, any men are known to
  have taken of <i>Opium</i>? and how prepared?</p>

  <p>3. What effects are observed from their use, not only of <i>Opium</i>
  (already mention'd) but also of Coffee, Bathing, shaving their Heads,

  <p>9. What Arts or Trades they have worth Learning?</p>

  <p>10. Whether there be such a Tree about <i>Damascus</i>, call'd
  <i>Mouslat</i>, which every year about the Month of <i>December</i> is
  cut down close by the root, and within four or five Months time shoots up
  again apace, bringing forth Leaves, Flowers, and Fruit also, and bearing
  but one Apple (an excellent Fruit) at once?</p>

  <p>11. Whether about <i>Reame</i> in the Southern part of <i>Arabia
  F&oelig;lix</i>, there be Grapes without any grains? And whether the
  people in that Country live, many of them, to a hundred and twenty years,
  in good health?</p>

  <p>12. Whether in <i>Candia</i> there be no poysonous Creatures; and
  whether those Serpents, that are there, are without poyson?</p>

  <p>13. Whether all Fruits, Herbs, Earth, Fountains, are naturally saltish
  in the Isle of <i>Cyprus</i>? And whether those parts of this Isle, which
  abound in <i>Cyprus-trees</i>, are more or less healthful, than

  <p>14. What store of <i>Amianthus</i> there is in <i>Cyprus</i>; and how
  they work it?</p>

  <p>15. Whether <i>Mummies</i> be found in the sands of <i>Arabia</i>,

  <p>16. Whether the parts about the City of <i>Constantinople</i> or
  <i>Asia Minor</i>, be as subject to Earth-quakes now, as they have been
  formerly? And whether the Eastern Winds do not Plague the said City with
  Mists, and cause that inconstancy of Weather, it is said to be subject
  to?</p>

  <p>17. Whether the Earth-quakes in <i>Zant</i> and <i>Cephalonia</i> be
  so frequent, as now and then to happen nine or ten times a Month? And
  whether these Isles be not very Cavernous?</p>

  Country is full, and which by the ignorant are not thought worth notice
  or preservation? And particularly, what is the bigness and structure of
  the Aquaeducts, made in several places about <i>Constantinople</i> by
  <i>Solyman</i> the Magnificent? <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<h3><i>An Observation of Optick Glasses made of
</i>Rock-Chrystal<i>.</i></h3>

<div class="sidenoter">* It may be queried whether those were true Veins, or only Superficial Strictures, and slight scratches.</div>
  <p>This is contained in a Letter of <i>Eustachio Divini</i>, Printed in
  <i>Italian</i> at <i>Rome</i>, as the <i>39. Journal des Scavans</i>
  extracts it, <i>vid.</i></p>

  <p>Though it be commonly believed, that <i>Rock-Christal</i> is not fit
  for Optick-Glasses, because there are many Veins in it; yet <i>Eustachio
  Divini</i> made one of it, which <i>he saith</i> proved an excellent one,
  though full of Veins. *</p>

<h3><i>An Accompt of the Use of the Grain of </i>Kermes<i>
for Coloration.</i></h3>

  <p>This was communicated by the Ingenious Dr. <i>Croon</i>, as he
  received it from one Monsieur <i>Verny</i>, a <i>French</i> Apothecary at
  <i>Montpelier</i>; who having described the Grain of <i>Kermes</i>, to be
  an excrescence growing upon the Wood, and often upon the <!-- Page 363
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page363"></a>{363}</span>leaves of a
  Shrub, plentifull in <i>Languedock</i>, and gather'd in the end of
  <i>May</i>, and the beginning of <i>June</i>, full of a red Juyce;
  subjoyns two Uses, which that Grain hath, the one for <i>Medicine</i>,
  the other for <i>Dying of Wool</i>. Waving the <i>first</i>, notice shall
  only be taken here of the <i>latter</i>, vid. That, for <i>Dying</i>,
  they take the Grain of <i>Kermes</i>, when ripe, and spread it upon
  Linnen: And at first, whilst it abounds most in moisture, 'tis turn'd
  twice or thrice a day, to prevent its Heating. And when there appears red
  powder amongst it, they separate it, passing it through a Searce; and
  then again spread abroad the Grain upon Linnen, untill there be perceived
  the same redness of the powder; and at the end, this red power appears
  <i>about</i> and <i>on</i> the surface of the Grain, which is still to be
  pass'd through a Searce, till it render no more.</p>

  <p>And in the beginning, when the small red Grains are seen to move (as
  they will do) they are sprinkled over with strong Vinegar, and rubb'd
  between ones hands: afterwards little balls are form'd thereof, which are
  expos'd to the Sun to dry.</p>

  <p>If this red powder should be let alone, without pouring Vinegar or
  some other accid liquor upon it, out of every Grain thereof would be
  form'd a little Fly, which would skip and fly up and down for a day or
  two, and at last changing its colour, fall down quite dead, deprived of
  all the bitterness, the Grains, whence they are generated, had
  before.</p>

  <p>The Grain being altogether emptyed of its pulp or red powder, 'tis
  wash'd in Wine, and then expos'd to the Sun Being well dryed, 'tis rubb'd
  in a Sack to render it bright; and then 'tis put up in small Sacks,
  putting in the midst, according to the quantity, the Grain has afforded,
  10. or 12. pounds (for a <i>Quintal</i>) of the dust, which is the red
  powder, that came out of it. And accordingly, as the Grain affords more
  or less of the said powder, Dyers buy more or less of it.</p>

  <p>'Tis to be noted, That the first red powder, which appears, issues out
  of the Hole of the Grain, that is on the side, where the Grain adhered to
  the Plant. And that, which about the end appears sticking on the Grain,
  hath been alive in the husk, having pierced its covers though the hole,
  whence it commonly issues, remains close as to the Eye. <!-- Page 364

<h3><i>An Account of Some Books lately published.</i></h3>

  <p>1. <i>PINAX Rerum Naturalium <span class="correction" title="Original reads `BRITANIARUM'."

  &amp; utriusque</i> Societatis Regiæ <i>socio.</i></p>

  <p>The Learned and Inquisitive Author of this Book, hath by his laudable
  example of collecting together, what Natural things are to be found here
  in <i>England</i>, of all sorts (which he has done upon his own expences)
  given an invitation to the curious in all parts of the world to attempt
  the like, thereby to establish the much desired and highly useful
  commerce among <i>Naturalists</i>, and to contribute every where to the
  composing of a genuine and full <i>History of Nature</i>.</p>

  <p>In the <i>Preface</i> he intimates, that his stock does still encrease
  dayly; and that therefore the Reader may expect an <i>Appendix</i> to
  this collection.</p>

  <p>In the Body of the Book, he enumerates all the <i>Species</i>,
  Alphabetically: And, as to <i>Vegetables</i>, he reckons up about 410
  sorts; and gives their <i>Latine</i> and <i>English</i> Names, and the
  <i>Places</i> and <i>Times</i> of their growth: reducing them afterwards
  to certain <i>Classes</i>, hitherto used by <i>Botanick</i> Writers in
  their <i>Histories</i> of <i>Plants</i>: Adding the <i>Etymology</i> of
  their Generick Names, and a compendious <i>Register</i> of the Time,
  <i>when</i> and <i>how long</i> the <i>English</i> Plants do shoot and
  flourish.</p>

  <p>As to <i>Animals</i>, he finds of them about 340 kinds in
  <i>England</i>, whereof the <i>fourfooted</i> are about 50, <i>Birds</i>
  170, and <i>Fishes</i> 120. <i>Insects</i> are innumerable, which yet he
  endeavours to enumerate, and to reduce to certain <i>Classes</i>; into
  which he also brings the three former kinds.</p>

  <p>Concerning <i>Fossils</i>, he <i>first</i> takes notice of the
  <i>Metals</i> found in <i>English</i> Mines; as <i>Silver, Tin, Copper,
  Iron, Lead, Antimony</i>, and some <i>Gold</i> extracted out of
  <i>Tin</i>. Next of the <i>Stones</i>, of which he finds about 70 sorts;
  &amp; amongst them, <i>Bristol Diamonds, Agates, Hyacinths, Emerods,
  Loadstones, Toad-stones</i>, (which last yet he affirms to be nothing but
  the grinding-teeth of the <!-- Page 365 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page365"></a>{365}</span>Fish <i>Lupus</i>) <i>Pearls, Corals,
  Marble, Alablaster, Emery:</i> To which he adds the various kinds of
  <i>Coals</i>; as also <i>Bitumens, Turfs</i> and <i>Jets</i>. And
  <i>thirdly</i> of the various kinds of <i>Allam, Vitriol, Niter,
  Sea-salt, Pit-salt</i>. But <i>fourthly</i> of the various <i>Earths</i>,
  of which he reckons up 15. peculiar sorts (besides those that serve for
  <i>Husbandry</i>, which are not easily numbred;) and amongst them,
  <i>Read-lead, Black-lead</i> and <i>Fullers-earth</i>.</p>

  <p>He concludes all with mentioning the several <i>Meteors</i> appearing
  in <i>England</i>; and the <i>Hot springs</i>; and <i>Medical Waters</i>;
  as also, the <i>Salin, Petrifying</i>, and some more unusual Springs:
  <i>Item, Subterraneous Trees, Subterraneous Rivers, Ebbings and Flowings
  of Wells</i>, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>II. <i>PLACITA PHILOSOPHICA Guarini.</i> The chief subject of this
  Treatise is Natural <i>Philosophy</i>; upon many important questions
  whereof it enlargeth, as those of the Motion of the C&oelig;lestial
  Bodies, of Light, of Meteors, and of the vital and animal functions;
  leaving sometimes the common opinions, and delighting in the defence of
  <i>Paradoxes</i>.</p>

  <p><i>E. G.</i> That the material substantial Form, is nothing but
  <i>mera potentia</i>, and subsists not by it self: by which means the
  Author judges, he can free himself from many great difficulties touching
  <i>Generation</i> and <i>Corruption</i>, which do perplex the other
  Philosophers.</p>

  <p>He holds <i>Epicycles</i> to be impossible, and <i>Excentricks</i>,
  not sufficient to explicate the motion of the Stars; but that all the
  irregularities of this motion may be salved by the means of certain
  <i>Spiral</i> Lines; largely proving this <i>Hypothesis</i>, and
  particularly explicating the motion of each Planet.</p>

  <p>He denies the middle Region of the Air to be cold; and believes that
  cold is not necessary to condense the vapours into Water.</p>

  <p>He admits not that received Axiome, <i>That the generation of one Body
  is the corruption of another</i>; maintaining that there are
  <i>Generations</i>, to which no corruption ever preceded; and that it may
  happen, that one Animal without dying may be changed into another
  Animal.</p>

  <p>He alledges several reasons to evince, that the Air breathed in,
  enters not only into the whole capacity of the Chest, but also into the
  lower belly. <!-- Page 366 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page366"></a>{366}</span></p>

  <p>He is of opinion that the Air, which is commonly believed to corrupt
  easily, is incorruptible; alledging among other reasons, this for one,
  that experience shews, that if a Bottle be exactly stop'd, there is never
  any mixt Body form'd in it; wherefore, <i>saith he</i>, the Air is not
  corrupted there.</p>

  <p>He maintains, that 'tis not the <i>Magnet</i> that draws the Iron, but
  rather the Iron that attracts the <i>Magnet</i>. To explain which he
  affirms, that the Load-stone spreads abroad out of it self many
  corpuscles, which the substance of the Iron imbibes, and that, as dry
  things attract those that are moist, by the same reason Iron drawn the
  Loadstone.</p>

  <p>He rejects the <i>species intentionales</i>, <i>Vital</i> and
  <i>Animal</i> Spirits, and holds many other uncommon opinions, touching
  <i>Light</i>, the <i>Iris</i>, the <i>Flux and Reflux of the Sea</i>,
  <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>III. <i>GUSTUS ORGANUM per </i>Laurentium Bellini<i> novissimè
  deprehensum.</i></p>

  <p>The Author proposing to himself to discover both the principal
  <i>Organ</i> of the <i>Taste</i>, and the nature of its <i>object</i>,
  begins with the latter, and examins first, what is <i>Taste?</i> He
  judges that it is caused by nothing but Salts, which being variously
  figured, affects the tongue variously: alledging this for his chief
  reason, that the Salt which is extracted by <i>Chymists</i> out of any
  mixt body whatever it be, carries away with it all its taste, and that
  the rest remains tasteless. He adds that the Teeth in grinding the Food,
  serve much to extract this Salt: And he notes by the by, that the Teeth
  are so necessary for preparing the aliment, that certain Animals which
  seem to have none, have them in their stomach; and that nature has put at
  the entry of the palat of those that are altogether destitute of them,
  certain moveable inequalities, which are to them instead of Teeth.</p>

  <p>But then <i>secondly</i>, concerning the <i>Organ</i> of Taste, he
  esteems, that 'tis neither the Flesh, nor the Tongue, nor the Membrans,
  nor the Nerves found there, nor the Glanduls, called <i>Amygdalinæ</i>;
  but those <i>little eminences</i> that are found upon the tongue of all
  Animals. To obtain which, he observes,</p>

  <p>1. That from the middle of the Tongue to the root, as also towards the
  tip, there are found innumerable <i>little Risings</i> <!-- Page 367
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page367"></a>{367}</span>called
  <i>Papillares</i>; but that from the tip of the Tongue unto the string
  there is observed none at all.</p>

  <p>2. He hath experimented, that if you put <i>Sal Armoniack</i> upon the
  places of the Tongue, where those <i>Eminencies</i> are not, you shall
  find no Taste; but that you will find it presently assoon as you put any
  such Salt, where they are to be met with. Ergo, <i>saith he</i>, those
  <i>Eminencies</i> are the principal Organ of Taste.</p>

  <p>3. He assures, that with a <i>Microscope</i>, may be seen in those
  <i>Risings</i> many little holes, at the bottom whereof there are small
  nerves, terminating there: But <i>he directs</i>, to observe this in live
  and healthy, not in dead or sick Animals.</p>

  <p>Having laid down these Observations, he concludes, that the manner,
  after which Taste is perform'd, is this, That the particles of Salt
  passing through those pores, which pierce the <i>Papillary Eminences</i>,
  and penetrating as far as to the nerves, that meet them there, do by the
  means of their small points prick them; which pricking is called the
  <i>Taste</i>.</p>

  <p>In the mean time he acknowledges, that before him Signior
  <i>Malphigi</i>, Professor at <i>Messina</i>, had made some of these
  discoveries.</p>

  <p>The notice of these two last Books we owe to the <i>French
  Journal</i>.</p>

<h3><i>An Extract
of a Letter written </i>Decemb. 28. 1666<i>. by M. </i>Auzout<i> to the
Publisher, concerning a way of his, for taking the </i>Diameters<i>
of the </i>Planets<i>, and for knowing the </i>Parallax<i> of the </i>Moon<i>;
as also the Reason, why in the </i>Solar Eclipse<i> above calculated,
the </i>Diameter<i> of the </i>Moon<i> did increase about the end.</i></h3>

  <p>I did apply my self the last Summer to the taking of the
  <i>Diameters</i> of the Sun, Moon, and the other Planets, by a Method,
  which one M. <i>Picard</i> and my self have, esteem'd by Us the best of
  all those, that have been practis'd hitherto; since we can take the
  <i>Diameters</i> to <i>Second Minutes</i>, being able to divide one foot
  into 24000. or 30000. parts, scarce failing as much as in one only part,
  so as we can in a manner be <i>assur'd</i>, not to deceive our selves in
  3. or 4. <i>seconds</i>. I shall not now tell you my Observations, but I
  may very well assure you, that the <i>Diameter</i> of the <i>Sun</i> has
  not been much less in his <i>Apogee</i>, than 31. m. 37. or 40. sec. and
  certainly not lesse than 31. m. 35. sec. and that at present in his
  <i>Perigee</i> it passes not 32. m. 45. sec. and may be lesse by a second
  or two. That, which is at the present troublesome, is, that the
  <i>Vertical</i> Diameter, which is the most easie to take, is diminisht,
  even at <i>Noon</i>, by 8. or 9. sec., because of the <i>Refractions</i>,
  which are much greater in Winter than Summer at the same height; and that
  the <i>Horizontal</i> Diameter is difficult, because of the swift motion
  of the Heavens.</p>

  <p>As for the <i>Moon</i>, I never yet found her Diameter less than 29.
  m. 44. or 45. sec. and I have not seen it pass 33. m. or if it hath, it
  was only by a few <i>seconds</i>. But I have not yet taken her in all the
  kinds of situations of the <i>Apogees</i> and <i>Perigees</i> which
  happen, with the <i>Conjunctions</i> and <i>Quadratures</i>. I do not
  mention all, what can be deduced from thence, but if you have Persons at
  <i>London</i>, that observe these <i>Diameters</i>, we may entertain our
  selves more about this Subject, another time. I shall only tell you, that
  I have found a Way to know the <i>Parallax</i> of the <i>Moon</i>, by the
  means of her <i>Diameter</i>: <i>Vid</i>. If on a day, when she is to be
  in her <i>Apogee</i> or <i>Perigee</i>, and in the most <i>Boreal</i>
  Signes, you take her Diameter towards the <i>Horizon</i>, and then
  towards the <i>South</i>, with her <i>Altitudes</i> <!-- Page 374
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page374"></a>{374}</span>above the
  Horizon. For, if the Observation of the Diameters be exact; as in these
  Situations the Moon changes not considerably her Distance from the Earth
  in 6. or 7. hours, the <i>Difference</i> of the Diameters will shew the
  Proportion there is of her Distance, with the Semi-diameter of the Earth.
  I do not enlarge, because that as soon as one hath this <i>Idea</i>, the
  rest is easie. The same would yet be practis'd better in the places,
  where the Moon passes through the <i>Zenith</i>, than here, for the
  greater the difference is of the Heights, the greater is that of the
  Diameters. I do not note (for it easily appears) that, if one were under
  the same <i>Meridian</i>, or the same <i>Azimuth</i> in two very
  different places, and took at the same time the Diameter of the Moon, one
  would do the same thing, though this Method goes not to preciseness.</p>

  <p>From what has been said, may be collected the reason of the
  Observation, which M. <i>Hevelius</i> made in the last <i>Eclipse of the
  Sun</i>, touching the increase of the Moon's Diameter about the end. I am
  exceeding glad, that a person, who probably knew not the cause of it, has
  made the Experiment: but it is strange, that until now no Astronomer has
  foreseen, that that should happen, nor given any precepts for the Change
  of the <i>Moons Diameter</i> in the <i>Eclipses of the Sun</i>, according
  to the places, where they should happen, and according to the Hour and
  Height, the Moon should have. For, what hapned in that <i>Eclipse</i> of
  Augmentation, would have faln out contrarily, if it had been in the
  Evening; for, the Moon, which in that <i>Eclipse</i>, that began in the
  Morning, was higher about the end than at the beginning, was nearer us,
  and consequently was to appear bigger: But if the <i>Eclipse</i> should
  happen in the Evening, she would be lower at the end, and therefore more
  distant from us, and consequently appear lesser. So also in two different
  places, whereof one should have the Eclipse in the Morning, and the other
  at Noon, the Moon should appear bigger to him that hath it at Noon: And
  she must likewise appear bigger to those, who shall have a leser
  <i>Elevation</i> of the <i>Pole</i> under the same <i>Meridian</i>,
  because the Moon will be nearer them.</p>

  <p>I wish, I could satisfie you about the <i>Optick Glasses</i> of
  Signior <i>Burattini</i> in <i>Poland</i>, which he hath sent hither; but
  I have not yet seen their performances my self. I only saw once the
  Glasses, <!-- Page 375 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page375"></a>{375}</span>which are perfectly well wrought and well
  polisht. Those, that have tried them, find them very good; but they are
  only, the one of 10, the other of 8. foot. A good Astronomer told me,
  that they would bear a great <i>Aperture</i> in respect of their
  length.</p>

  <p>I do not well know, what to say to yours concerning M.
  <i>Hevelius</i>. Mean while, the interest of truth, and the obliging
  manner, he has treated me with, engage me to answer him, in the matter of
  the <i>Comets</i>: I am perswaded, I shall convince him; but since he
  hath taken the <i>Illustrious Royal Society</i> for Judge, I accept that
  with all my heart.</p>

<h3><i>A Relation
of the loss of the Way to prepare the </i>Bononian Stone<i>
for shining.</i></h3>

<div class="sidenoter">* It is hoped notwithstanding (which also a late Letter from abroad does hint) that some or other of the <i>Italian</i> Vertuosi at <i>Florence</i> have secured this Secret.</div>
  <p>Though several Persons have pretended to know the Art of preparing and
  calcining the <i>Bononian</i> Stone, for keeping a while the Light once
  imbibed; yet there hath been indeed but one, who had the true secret of
  performing it. This was an <i>Ecclesiastick</i>, who is now dead, without
  having left that skill of his to any one, as Letters from <i>Italy</i>
  and <i>France</i>, some while since, did inform. There is no substance,
  in Nature, known to us, that hath the effect of this Stone; so that (to
  the shame of the present Age) this <i>Phænomenon</i> is not like to be
  found any where, but in Books, except some happy <i>Genius</i> light upon
  same or the like skill. *</p>

<h3><i>A Description
of a </i>Swedish<i> Stone, which affords </i>Sulphur<i>, </i>Vitriol<i>,
</i>Allum<i> and </i>Minium<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>This was communicated to the <i>R. Society</i> by Sir <i>Gilbert
  Talbot</i> Knight, a Worthy Member of that Body, as he had received it in
  <i>Denmark</i>, being his Majesties Extraordinary Envoy there; as
  follows,</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:16%;">
      <a href="images/VI_N21_Fig4.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/VI_N21_Fig4.png"
      alt="Fig. 4." title="Fig. 4." /></a>
  </div>
  <p>There is a Stone in <i>Sweden</i> of a Yellow Colour, intermixed with
  streaks of white (as if composed of Gold and Silver) and heavy withal. It
  is found in firm Rocks, and runs in Veins, <!-- Page 376 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page376"></a>{376}</span>upon which they lay
  Wood, and set it on fire. When the Stone is thus heated, they cast Water
  upon it, to make it rend, and then dig it up with Mattocks. This done,
  they break it into smaller pieces; and put it into Iron-pots, of the
  shape represented by <i>Figure</i> C; the mouth of the one going into the
  other. These they place, the <i>one</i> in the Oven upon an Iron fork
  sloping, so that, the Stone being melted, it may run into the
  <i>other</i>, which stands at the mouth of the Oven, supported upon an
  Iron. The first running of the Stone is <i>Sulphur</i>.</p>

  <p>The remainder of the burned Stone is carry'd out, and laid upon a high
  Hill, where it lies exposed to the Sun and Air for the space of two
  years, and then taketh fire of it self, casting forth a thin blew flame,
  scarce discernable in the day time. This being consumed, leaveth a blew
  dust behind it; which the Workmen observe, and mark with woodden pins.
  This they dig up, and carry into the <span class="correction"
  title="Original reads `Work-honse'.">Work-house</span>, and put it into
  great Tubs of Water, where it infuseth 24. hours or more. The Water they
  afterward boyl in Kettles, as we do Saltpeter, and put it into cooling
  Tubs, wherein they place crosse Sticks, and on them the <i>Vitriol</i>
  fastens, as Sugar-candy doth.</p>

  <p>The Water, that remains after the extraction of the <i>Vitriol</i>,
  they mix with an eight part of Urin and the Lees of Wood-ashes, which is
  again boyled very strong, and being set to cool in Tubbs, crosse Sticks
  are likewise placed, and thereon the <i>Allum</i> fastens.</p>

  <p>In the Water, which remains after the <i>Allum</i>, is found a
  Sediment, which being separated from the Water, is put into an Oven, and
  Wood laid upon it and fired, till it become red, which makes the
  <i>Minium</i>, wherewith they paint their Houses, and make plaister.</p>

  <p><i>So far this Description</i>; Which gave occasion to a curious
  person to call to mind, That there was a kind of Stone in the
  <i>North</i> of <i>England</i>, yielding the same substances, except
  <i>Minium</i>. <!-- Page 377 --><span class="pagenum"><a

<h3><i>A Relation
of the Raining of </i>Ashes<i>, in the </i>Archipelago<i>, upon the Eruption
of Mount </i>Vesuvius<i>, some years ago.</i></h3>

  <p>This came but lately to hand from that knowing person, Mr. <i>Henry
  Robinson</i>, and was thought fit to be now inserted here, that it might
  not be lost, though it hath hapned above 30 years ago. It was contained
  in a Letter, (subscribed by Capt. <i>Will. Badily</i>) in these
  words:</p>

<div class="sidenoter">* Some of these Ashes were produced by Mr. <i>John Evelyn</i>, before the <i>Royal Society</i>.</div>
  <p>The 6<sup>th.</sup> of <i>December</i> 1631, being in the Gulf of
  <i>Volo</i>, riding at Anchor, about ten of the Clock that Night, it
  began to rain Sand or Ashes, and continued till two of the Clock the next
  Morning. It was about two inches thick on the Deck, so that we cast it
  over board with Shovels, as we did Snow the day before: The quantity of a
  Bushel we brought home, and presented to several Friends *, especially to
  the Masters of <i>Trinity House</i>. There was in our Company, Capt.
  <i>John Wilds</i> Commander of the <i>Dragon</i>, and Capt. <i>Anthony
  Watts</i>, Commander of the <i>Elisabeth</i> and <i>Dorcas</i>. There was
  no Wind stirring, when these Ashes fell, it did not fall onely in the
  places, where we were, but likewise in other parts, as Ships were coming
  from St. <i>John D'Acre</i> to our Port; they being at that time a
  hundred Leagues from us. We compared the Ashes together, and found them
  both one. If you desire to see the Ashes, let me know.</p>

<h3><i>An Extract
Of A Letter not long since written from </i>Rome<i>, rectifying the
Relation of </i>Salamanders<i> living in Fire.</i></h3>

  <p>This came from that Expert Anatomist M. <i>Steno</i>, to Dr. <i>Croone
  Videl</i>. That a Knight called <i>Corvini</i>, had assured him, that,
  having cast a <i>Salamander</i>, brought him out of the <i>Indies</i>,
  into the Fire, the Animal thereupon swell'd presently, and then vomited
  store of thick slimy matter, which did put out the neighbouring Coals, to
  which the <i>Salamander</i> retired immediately, putting them out again
  in the same manner, as soon as they <!-- Page 378 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page378"></a>{378}</span>rekindled, and by this
  means saving himself from the force of the Fire, for the space of two
  hours, the Gentleman above-mentioned being then unwilling to hazard the
  Creature any further: That afterwards it lived nine Months: That he had
  kept it eleven Months without any other food, but what it took by licking
  the Earth, on which it moved, and on which it had been brought out of the
  <i>Indies</i>; which at first was covered with a thick moisture, but
  being dried afterwards, the Urin of the Animal served to moisten the
  same. After the eleven Months, the Owner having a mind to try, how the
  Animal would do upon <i>Italian</i> Earth, it died three dayes after it
  had changed the Earth.</p>

<h3><i>An Account
of several Engagements for Observing of Tydes.</i></h3>

  <p>Since nothing is more important for discovering the Cause of that
  Grand <i>Phænomenon</i> of Nature, the <i>Flux</i> and <i>Reflux of the
  Sea</i>, than a true and full <i>History of the Tydes</i>; the
  <i>Virtuosi</i> of <i>England</i> have of late (especially since the
  Publication of Dr. <i>Wallis</i> his <i>Theory</i> touching that
  <i>Apparence</i>) taken care, to direct and recommend in several parts of
  the World, and particularly in the most proper places of these
  <i>Ilands</i>, such Observations, as may contribute to the elucidating of
  that Subject.</p>

  <p>And as formerly they have sent their <i>Inquiries</i> of this Nature
  to the Isle of St. <i>Helena</i>, situated in the open Ocean beyond the
  <i>Æquinoctial</i>, and already received some account thereupon; so they
  have since dispatcht the like for the <i>Bermudas</i>, an <i>Isle</i>
  that hath no less conveniency of situation for that purpose. And they
  intend (as will more amply appear, God permitting, in a short time) to
  lodge with such Masters of Ships and Pilots, as shall sayl into remote
  parts, very particular directions of that kind, to be printed at the
  <i>Royal Societies</i> charges, and to be committed to the care of the
  Masters of <i>Trinity House</i> for disposing of them to that end.</p>

  <p>And, as for the Observations, to be made in these Kingdoms; 'tis
  hoped, that the Masters in the Art of Navigation at <i>Bristol</i> (Mr.
  <i>Standridge</i> and Mr. <i>Iff</i>) will undertake that business with
  affection and care: the former of these two having already (as we are
  informed from a good hand) made a Collection of the Tydes; <!-- Page 379
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page379"></a>{379}</span>for some years
  past, and found them differing from former Observations and Tables; the
  other promising future diligence in this matter; noting in the mean time,
  that some Tydes of last Autumn were so far differing from former
  Observations, that neither he, nor any others there, could make any thing
  of it.</p>

  <p>We must not omit here to mention the readiness, expressed by these
  worthy Gentlemen, Mr. <i>Rob. Boyle</i>, Sir <i>Rob. Moray</i>, and Mr.
  <i>Henry Powle</i>, for concurring in this Work; the first, having
  undertaken to recommend Observations of this nature, to be made, upon the
  <i>Western</i> Coast of <i>Ireland</i> *; the second, upon the West of
  <i>Scotland</i>; and the third, in the Isle of <i>Lundy</i>; to whom we
  must adde the inquisitive Mr. <i>Sam. Colepresse</i>, for
  <i>Plymouth</i>, and the <i>Lands-end</i>. Besides, we hope to engage the
  curious of <i>France</i> in the same undertaking, especially for
  procuring, besides what is known already concerning that place, a very
  particular and exact account of the Tydes upon the Coast of
  <i>Britany</i>, where (especially about St. <i>Malo</i>) they are found
  to rise to admiration, even to 60, 70, and sometime 80, feet, at the New
  and Full Moon.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>* The Observations particularly recommended for that Coast, are
  these;</p>

  <p>1. At what hour it is High-water on the day of the New and Full Moon,
  upon every Cape and Bay of the Western Coast of <i>Ireland</i>.</p>

  <p>2. How long after the New and Full Moon the highest Spring-tides fall
  out.</p>

  <p>3. What are the perpendicular heights of the Flood, both at the
  ordinary, and the Spring-tydes.</p>

<h3><i>Some Suggestions
for Remedies against </i>Cold<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>As there have been Remedies found out against excessive <i>Heat</i>,
  and Means of cooling Meat and Drink; so it was lately, on the occasion of
  the sharp Season, suggested, That Remedies might be thought on against
  <i>Cold</i>; and that particularly it might be inquired into,</p>

  <p>1. What things in Nature, or by Art, or Mechanical <span
  class="correction" title="Original reads `contri-trivance' across line break."
  >contrivance</span> will retain a warming Heat longest, or a melting or
  scorching Heat?</p>

  <p>2. What will continue or maintain Fire longest?</p>

  <p>Some that observe common practises and vulgar Trades, take notice,
  That <i>Joyners</i> use <i>Leaden-Pots</i> for their Glue, alledging for
  a Reason, That Lead, being a close Mettal, retains the heat <!-- Page 380
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page380"></a>{380}</span>longer than
  other Mettals. <i>Cary</i>'s Warming-stone promised a warmth for six or
  eight hours; if it performed but for two or three hours, it would be of
  great use. 'Tis found by sad experience, how hurtful Bright Fires, and
  especially of Stone-coal are to the Eyes.</p>

  <p>To retain Fire long, certain <i>Black</i> Earths are useful, as we
  were newly informed by the Inquisitive Dr. <i>B.</i> That a Gentleman in
  <i>Sommertsetshire</i>, called Mr. <i>Speke</i>, had bountifully obliged
  <i>Ilminster</i>, and his Neighborhood, by a Black Fat-Earth lately found
  in his Park. But the same Correspondent adds, That he never saw any
  parallel to a <i>Sea-weed</i>, which he and some of his Fellow-Students
  had in <i>Cambridge</i> in the mouth of a Barrel of good Oysters. It was
  smaller than Pease-halm, yet cut, it lasted two very great Fires of
  Sea-coal, burning bright in the midst of the Fire; and by a stroak of the
  Tongues, it fell into the Hearth, jingling like Mettal.</p>

<h3><i>A Relation
of an uncommon Accident in two Aged Persons.</i></h3>

  <p>This was imparted by the above-mentioned Mr. <i>Colepresse</i>, who
  assures in his Letter, containing this Account, That the matter of fact
  was thorowly examined by himself, and that he was fully, and in all
  respects, satisfied of the truth thereof.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>The Relation of the one, is in these words.</i></p>

  <p><i>Joseh Shute</i> Clerk, Parson of <i>Mary</i> (nigh <i>Plymouth</i>)
  in the County of <i>Devon</i>, aged 81 years, being a temperate man, and
  of an healthy constitution, having the in-most Grinder loose, and so
  remaining, perceived, that his mouth, about three Moneths since, was
  somewhat streightned; and upon inquiry into the cause of it, found, That
  he had a new Tooth (the third Grinder) being the innermost of the upper
  Jaw in the Right Cheek, which still remains firm.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>The Account of the other follows thus.</i></p>

  <p><i>Maria Stert</i> of <i>Benecliffe</i>, in <i>Plympton St. Mary</i>
  (near <i>Plymouth</i>) in <i>Devon</i>, aged about 75 years, an healthy
  person, having had nine children, about the fortieth year of her age lost
  three of her <!-- Page 381 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page381"></a>{381}</span>upper <i>Incisores</i> or <i>Cutters</i>,
  the other drawn out, and so remained Toothless, as to them, for about 25
  years, when she perceived, that a new Tooth came forth (without any pain)
  next the <i>Canini</i> of the left <span class="correction"
  title="Original reads `Check:'.">Cheek:</span> And about two years after,
  another Tooth grew out likewise without pain, close by the former. The
  first whereof, never came to above half the length of her former
  <i>Cutters</i>, the latter scarce breaking the skin: Both which yet
  proved serviceable, till about six weeks since, when she eating (no hard,
  crusty, or solid) Meat, that Tooth which came out first, fell down into
  her Mouth, without any loosness before hand perceived, or any pain; which
  had not a phang like other <i>Cutters</i>, but much less, and shorter.
  The other abides firm, and serviceable.</p>

  <p>To the truth of these Relations, not onely the said <i>Joseph
  Shute</i> and <i>Maria Stert</i>, have put the one his name, the other
  her Mark, the third and seventh of <i>January</i>, 1666. but also Sir
  <i>William Strode</i>, and Mr. <i>Colepresse</i> have subscribed the
  same, as believing the Relation to be true.</p>

<h3><i>An Account of two Books.</i></h3>

  <p><i></i>I. ISMAELIS BULLIALDI<i> ad Astronomos Monita duo: Primum, De
  Stella Nova, quæ in Collo Ceti ante annos aliquot visa est. Alterum, De
  Nebulosa in Andromeda Cinguli parte Borea, ante biennium iterum
  orta.</i></p>

  <p>The chief end of the <i>Author</i> in publishing this Tract, seems to
  be, To excite Astronomers to a diligent observation, both of that <i>New
  Star</i> in the <i>Neck</i> of the <i>Whale</i>, to be seen in
  <i>February</i> and <i>March</i> next; and of that other, in the Northern
  part of <i>Andromeda's Girdle</i>, to be seen at this very present.</p>

  <p>As to the <i>former</i> of these Stars, <i>he affirms</i>, that, as it
  hath appeared for many years in the said place, so it will in the
  beginning of <i>March</i> next appear equal to the Stars of the <i>third
  Magnitude</i>, or perhaps bigger; and that about the end of the same
  Month, if the Crepuscle do not hinder, the greatest <i>Phasis</i> of it
  will appear, if so be, that it keep the same Analogy of Motions and
  Periods, which it observed from <i>An.</i> 1638. to <i>An.</i> 1664.
  Where he takes notice of the Causes, why its two greatest Appearances
  could not be seen, <i>An.</i> 1664, 1665, 1666; and how he <!-- Page 382
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page382"></a>{382}</span>comes to know,
  that in the beginning of <i>March</i> next, It will equal, or even exceed
  the Stars of the <i>Third Magnitude</i>; noting, that from the
  Observations hitherto made of this Star, it is manifest, that the
  <i>greatest Phases</i> thereof do every year anticipate by 32. or 33.
  dayes; forasmuch as <i>An.</i> 1660. its <i>greatest Appearance</i> was
  about the end of <i>October</i> and the beginning of <i>November</i>;
  <i>An.</i> 1661. about the end of <i>September</i>, or the beginning of
  <i>October</i>; <i>An.</i> 1662. about the end of <i>August</i>,
  <i>&amp;c.</i> so that this year it must be in <i>March</i>, if the
  former Analogy do hold.</p>

  <p>He collects also from the Observations, That one <i>Period</i> from
  the <i>greatest Phasis</i> to the next, consists of about 333. dayes: but
  that the interval of the time betwixt the times of its beginning to
  appear equal to the Stars of the <i>Sixt Magnitude</i>, and of its ending
  to do so, consists of about 120. dayes: And that its <i>greatest
  Appearance</i> lasts about 15. dayes: All which yet he would have
  understood with some latitude.</p>

  <p>This done, he proceeds to the investigation of the Causes of the
  Vicissitudes in the Emersion and Dis-appearance of this Star, and having
  discoursed, That the apparent Increase and Decrement of every Lucid Body
  proceeds <i>either</i> from its changed distance from the Eye of the
  Observer; <i>or</i> from its various site and position in respect of him,
  whereby the angle of Vision is changed; or from the increase or
  diminution of the bulk of the lucid body it self: and having also
  demonstrated it impossible, that this Star should move in a
  <i>Circle</i>, or in an <i>Ellipsis</i>; and proved it improbable that it
  should move in a <i>Strait Line</i>, he concludes, that there can be no
  other genuin, or at least, no other more probable cause of its Emersion
  and Occultation, than this, That the bigger part of that round Body is
  obscure and inconspicuous to us, and its lesser part lucid, the whole
  Body turning about its own Center, and one Axe; whereby for one
  determinate space of time it exhibits its lucid part to the Earth, for
  another, subducts it: it not being likely, that fires should be kindled
  in the Body of that Star, and that the matter thereof should at certain
  times take fire and shine, at other times be extinguisht upon the
  consumption of that matter.</p>

  <p><i>So far of that Star.</i> As to the other in the <i>Girdle</i> of
  <i>Andromeda</i>, seen about the beginning of <i>An.</i> 1665; he
  relates, that, when in the end of 1664. the World beheld the then
  appearing <i>Comet</i>, <!-- Page 383 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page383"></a>{383}</span>Astronomers observed also this new
  <i>Phænomenon</i>, which was called by them <i>Nebulosa in Cingulo
  Andromedæ</i>. Concerning which, he notes, that the same had been already
  seen many years before by <i>Simon Narius</i>, vid. <i>An.</i> 1612. when
  with a <i>Telescope</i> he search'd for the <i>Satellits</i> of
  <i>Jupiter</i>, and observed their motions; alledging for proof hereof,
  the said <i>Authors</i> own words, out of his own Book, <i>De Mundo
  Joviali</i>, publisht <i>An.</i> 1614. And farther shews, that it hath
  formerly appear'd (about 150. years ago) and been taken notice off by an
  expert, though Anonymous, Astronomer; whose words he cites out of a
  <i>Manuscript</i>, brought out of <i>Holland</i> by the Excellent
  <i>Jacobus Augustus Thuanus</i>, returning from his Embassy to
  <i>Paris</i>; wherein also was marked the <i>Figure</i> of that
  <i>Phænomenon</i>; represented in print by our Author: who from all this
  collects, that, whereas this Star hath been seen formerly, and that 150.
  years since, but yet neither observed by <i>Hipparchus</i>, nor any other
  of the Antients, that we can find; nor also in the former Age by <i>Tycho
  Brahe</i>, nor in our Age, by <i>Bayerus</i>; and appear'd also in the
  Month of <i>November</i> last (wherein he wrote this <i>Tract</i>) much
  lessened and obscure, after it had, two years ago, shone very bright;
  that therefore it must needs appear and dis-appear by turns, like those
  in the <i>Necks</i> of the <i>Whale</i> and <i>Swan</i>.</p>

  <p><i></i>II.<i> ENTRIENS sur les Vies et sur les Ouvrages</i> Des plus
  excellens Peintres, Anciens et Modernes, par Monsieur<i>
  FELIBIEN.</i></p>

  <p>This Author, having first discoursed of that Royal Pallace the
  <i>Louvre</i>, and the Designs of finishing it; passes on to the Art of
  <i>Picturing</i>, and treats of the three principal things, wherein a
  good Master of the Art must excel, <i>vid.</i> the Composition,
  Designing, and Laying on of Colours, which done, he ravels into the
  Origine, and deduces the Progress of Painting, and relates what is most
  remarkable in the Lives of the Antient Painters: And among many
  particulars, he observes in the Life of <i>Andreas de Sarte</i>, how
  difficult it is, to judge well of a Picture; relating, that a Duke of
  <i>Mantua</i>, having obtained of <i>Clement</i> VII. a Pourtrait of
  <i>Leo</i> X. which had been done by <i>Raphael Urbin</i>, and was at
  <i>Florence</i>, those of that Town being unwilling to lose so excellent
  a <!-- Page 384 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page384"></a>{384}</span>piece, caused a Copy thereof to be made by
  the said <i>Andreas de Sarte</i>, which they sent instead of the
  Original. This <i>Copy</i> was so perfect, that <i>Julio Romano</i>, who
  had been bred and taught by <i>Raphael</i>, and was one of the best
  Painters of <i>Italy</i>, took it for an <i>Original</i>; and would never
  have been undeceived, if one <i>Vasari</i> had not assured him, that it
  was but a Copy, which himself had seen made, and had not shew'd him
  certain marks, that were there put to discriminate it from the
  Original.</p>

  <p>In the <i>Second</i> Part, the Author has set down all that is
  requisite to judge and discourse well of Painting. But, to add Examples
  to Precepts, he discourses of the <i>Modern</i> Painters, and making a
  Description of their best Works, he takes occasion to observe, what is
  there found most excellent, and to shew, how they have put in practice
  the Rules of Art. He treats also of the declining of Painting, and
  affirms, that nothing considerable hath been done in it from the time of
  <i>Constantine</i>, till <i>An.</i> 1240. when one, <i>Cimabue</i>, began
  to raise this Art again. After this, he give a List of the Painters, that
  since have been famous for their Works, preferring before all others,
  <i>Raphael Urbin</i>. The last of all is the above-mention'd <i>Andrè de
  Sartes</i>, who died, <i>An.</i> 1530. and whom the liberality of
  <i>Francis</i> I. had drawn into <i>France</i>.</p>

for the Improvement of Tranfusing blood out of one live Animal
into another; promised </i>Numb. 20. p. <a href="#page357">357</a><i>.</i></h3>

  <p>The following <i>Queries</i> and <i>Tryals</i> were written long
  since, and read about a Moneth ago in the <i>R Society</i>, and do now
  come forth against the Authors intention, at the earnest desire of some
  Learned Persons, and particualrly of the worthy <i>Doctor</i>, to whom
  they were addressed; who thinks, they may excite and assist others in a
  matter, which, to be well prosecuted, will require many hands. At the
  reading of them, the <i>Author</i> declared, that of divers of them he
  thought he could fore-see the Events, but <!-- Page 386 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page386"></a>{386}</span>yet judged it fit, not
  to omit them, because the Importance of the <i>Theories</i>, they may
  give light to, may make the Tryals recompence the pains, whether the
  success favour the <i>Affirmative</i> or the <i>Negative</i> of the
  Question, by enabling us to determine the one or the other upon surer
  grounds, than we could otherwise do. And this Advertisement he desires
  may be applied to those other Papers of his, that consist of
  <i>Quæries</i> or proposed <i>Tryals</i>.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>The </i>Quæries<i> themselves follow.</i></p>

  <p>1. Whether by this way of Transfusing Blood; the disposition of
  Individual Animals of the same kind, may not be much altered? (As whether
  a <i>fierce</i> Dog, by being often quite new stocked with the blood of a
  <i>cowardly</i> Dog, may not become more tame; <i>&amp; vice versa,
  &amp;c</i>?)</p>

  <p>2. Whether immediately upon the unbinding of a Dog, replenisht with
  adventitious blood, he will know and fawn upon his Master; and do the
  like customary things as before? And whether he will do such things
  better or worse at some time after the Operation?</p>

  <p>3. Whether those Dogs, that have <i>Peculiarities</i>, will have them
  either abolisht, or at least much impaired by transfusion of blood? (As
  whether the blood of a <i>Mastiff</i>, being frequently transfused into a
  <i>Blood-hound</i>, or a <i>Spaniel</i>, will not prejudice them in point
  of scent?)</p>

  <p>4. Whether acquired Habits will be destroy'd or impair'd by this
  Experiment? (As whether a Dog, taught to fetch and carry, or to dive
  after Ducks, or to sett, will after frequent and full recruits of the
  blood of Dogs unfit for those Exercises, be as good at them, as
  before?)</p>

  <p>5. Whether any considerable change is to be observ'd in the Pulse,
  Urin, and other Excrements of the <i>Recipient</i> Animal, by this
  Operation, or the quantity of his insensible Transpiration?</p>

  <p>6. Whether the <i>Emittent</i> Dog, being full fed at such a distance
  of time before the Operation, that the mass of blood may be suppos'd to
  abound with <i>Chyle</i>, the <i>Recipient</i> Dog, being before hungry,
  will lose his appetite, more than if the <i>Emittent</i> Dogs blood had
  not been so chylous? And how long, upon a <!-- Page 387 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page387"></a>{387}</span>Vein opened of a Dog,
  the admitted blood will be found to retain <i>Chyle</i>?</p>

  <p>7. Whether a Dog may be kept alive without eating by the frequent
  Injection of the Chyle of another, taken freshly from the Receptacle,
  into the Veins of the <i>Recipient</i> Dog?</p>

  <p>8. Whether a Dog, that is <i>sick</i> of some disease chiefly
  imputable to the mass of blood, may be cured by exchanging it for that of
  a <i>sound</i> Dog? And whether a <i>sound</i> Dog may receive such
  diseases from the blood of a <i>sick</i> one, as are not otherwise of an
  infectious nature?</p>

  <p>9. What will be the Operation of frequently stocking (which is
  feasible enough) an <i>old</i> and feeble Dog with the blood of
  <i>young</i> ones, as to liveliness, dulness, drowsiness, squeamishness,
  &amp;c., <i>et vice versa</i>?</p>

  <p>10. Whether a <i>small</i> young Dog, by being often fresh stockt with
  the blood of a young Dog of a <i>larger</i> kind, will grow bigger, than
  the ordinary size of his own kind?</p>

  <p>11. Whether any Medicated Liquors may be injected together with the
  blood into the <i>Recipient</i> Dog? And in case they may, whether there
  will be any considerable difference found between the separations made on
  this occasion, and those, which would be made, in case such Medicated
  Liquors had been injected with some other Vehicle, or alone, or taken in
  at the mouth?</p>

  <p>12. Whether a Purging Medicine, being given to the <i>Emittent</i> Dog
  a while before the Operation, the <i>Recipient</i> Dog will be thereby
  purged, and how? (which Experiment may be hugely varied.)</p>

  <p>13. Whether the Operation may be successfully practis'd, in case the
  injected blood be that of an Animal of another <i>Species</i>, as of a
  <i>Calf</i> into a <i>Dog</i>, &amp;c. and of a <i>Cold</i> Animal, as of
  a <i>Fish</i>, or <i>Frog</i>, or <i>Tortoise</i>, into the Vessels of a
  <i>Hot</i> Animal, and <i>vice versa</i>?</p>

  <p>14. Whether the <i>Colour</i> of the Hair or Feathers of the
  <i>Recipient</i> Animal, by the frequent repeating of this Operation,
  will be changed into that of the <i>Emittent</i>?</p>

  <p>15. Whether by frequently transfusing into the same Dog, the blood of
  some Animal of another <i>Species</i>, something further, and more
  tending to some degrees of a change of <i>Species</i>, may <!-- Page 388
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page388"></a>{388}</span>be effected,
  at least in Animals near of Kin; (As Spaniels and Setting Dogs, Irish
  Grey-hounds and ordinary Grey-hounds, &amp;c?)</p>

  <p>16. Whether the Transfusion may be practic'd upon pregnant Bitches, at
  least at certain times of their gravidation? And what effect it will have
  upon the Whelps?</p>

  <p><i>There</i> were some other <i>Quæries</i> proposed by the same
  <i>Author</i>; as, the weighing of the <i>Emittent</i> Animal before the
  Operation, that (making an abatement for the Effluviums, and for the
  Excrements, if it voids any) it may appear, how much blood it really
  loses. To which were annext divers others not so fit to be perused but by
  <i>Physitians</i>, and therefore here omitted.</p>

<h3><i>A Method
for Observing the </i>Eclipses of the Moon<i>, free from the Common
Inconveniencies, as it was left by the Learned Mr. </i>Rook<i>, late
</i>Gresham<i>-Professor of Geometry.</i></h3>

  <p>Eclipses of the Moon are observed for two principal ends; One
  <i>Astronomical</i>, that by comparing Observations with Calculations,
  the <i>Theory</i> of the <i>Moons Motion</i> may be perfected, and the
  <i>Tables</i> thereof reformed: the other, <i>Geographical</i>, that by
  comparing among themselves the Observations of the same <i>Ecliptick
  Phases</i>, made in <i>divers</i> places, the <i>Difference</i> of
  <i>Meridians</i> or <i>Longitudes</i> of those places may be
  discerned.</p>

  <p>The Knowledge of the Eclipse's Quantity and Duration, the Shadows,
  Curvity, and Inclination, &amp;c. conduce only to the former of these
  ends. The exact time of the Beginning, Middle, and End of Eclipses, as
  also in <i>Total</i> ones, the Beginning and End of <i>Total</i>
  darkness, is useful for both of them.</p>

  <p>But because in Observations made by the <i>bare</i> Eye, these times
  considerably differ from those with a <i>Telescope</i>; and, because the
  <i>Beginning</i> of Eclipses, and the <i>End</i> of <i>Total</i>
  darkness, are scarce to be observed exactly, even with Glasses (none
  being able clearly to distinguish between the <i>True</i> Shadow and
  <i>Penumbra</i>, unless he hath seen, for some time before, the Line,
  separating them, pass along upon the Surface of the Moon;) and lastly,
  because in small <!-- Page 389 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page389"></a>{389}</span><i>Partial</i> Eclipses, the Beginning and
  End, and in <i>Total</i> ones of short continuance in the Shadow, the
  Beginning and End of <i>Total</i> darkness, are unfit for nice
  Observations, by reason of the slow change of <i>Apparences</i>, which
  the <i>Oblique</i> Motion of the Shadow then causeth. For these reasons I
  shall propound a <i>Method</i> peculiarly design'd for the Accomplishment
  of the <i>Geographical</i> end in Observing Lunar Eclipses, free (as far
  as is possible) from all the mentioned Inconveniences.</p>

  <p>For, <i>First</i>, It shall not be practicable without a Telescope.
  <i>Secondly</i>, The Observer shall alwayes have opportunity before his
  principal Observation, to note the Distinction between the <i>True
  Shadow</i> and the <i>Penumbra</i>. And, <i>Thirdly</i>, It shall be
  applicable to those Seasons of the Eclipse, when there is the suddenest
  Alteration in the <i>Apparences</i>.</p>

<p class="cenhead">To satisfie all which intents,</p>

  <p>Let there be of the Eminentest <i>Spots</i>, dispersed over all
  Quarters of the Moons Surface, a select number generally agreed on, to be
  constantly made use of, to this purpose, in all parts of the World. As,
  for Example, those, which <i>M. Hevelius</i> calleth,</p>

  <p>Let in each <i>Eclipse</i>, not all, but (for instance) three of these
  <i>Spots</i>, which then lie nearest to the <i>Ecliptick</i>, be exactly
  observed, when they are first touch'd by the <i>True</i> Shadow, and
  again, when they are just compleatly entred into it, and (if you please)
  also in the <i>Decrease</i> of the Eclipse, when they are first fully
  clear from the <i>True</i> Shadow: For the accurate determinations of

  eminent in discharging the Trust, his Majesty hath reposed in him, of
  Ambassador Extraordinary to the King of <i>Spain</i>; so he forgets not
  in the midst of that Employment, that he is a Member of the <i>Royal
  Society</i>; but does from time to time, when his weighty
  State-Negotiations do permit, imploy himself in making considerable
  Observations of divers kinds, both <i>Astronomical</i> and
  <i>Physiological</i>; and communicateth the same to the said
  <i>Society</i>; as for instance, lately, what he has observ'd concerning
  the <i>Solar Eclipse</i> in <i>June</i> last, the Suns height in the
  Solstice, and also the Latitude of <i>Madrid</i>, esteeming by the Suns
  Altitude in the <i>Solstice</i>, and by other Meridian Altitudes, the
  <i>Latitude</i> of <i>Madrid</i> to be 40 deg. 10 min; which differs
  considerably from that assigned by others; the General Chart of
  <i>Europe</i> giving to it 41 deg. 30 min. the General Map of
  <i>Spain</i>, 40 deg. 27 min. A large Provincial Map of <i>Castile</i>,
  40 deg. 38 min.</p>

  <p>To these particulars, and others formerly imparted, his Excellency is
  making more of the same nature; and particularly those of the Immersion
  of the <i>Satellites</i> of <i>Jupiter</i>.</p>

  <p>We must not omit mentioning here, what he hath observed of
  <i>Halo</i>'s about the <i>Moon</i>; which he relates in these words;</p>

  <p><i>Decemb.</i> 25. <i>Old Style</i>, 1666. In the Evening, here (vid.
  at <i>Madrid</i>) was a great <i>Halo</i> about the Moon, the
  <i>Semidiameter</i> whereof was about 23 deg. 30 min. <i>Aldebaran</i>
  was just in the <i>North-east</i> part of the <i>Circle</i>, and the two
  Horns of <i>Aries</i> just enclosed by the <i>South-west</i> of the
  <i>Circle</i>, the Moon being in the <i>Center</i>. I note this the
  rather (<i>saith he</i>) because five or six years ago, vid.
  <i>Novemb.</i> 21. <i>Old Style</i>, 1661. an hour after Sun-set, I saw a
  great <i>Halo</i> about the Moon of the same <i>Semidiameter</i>, <!--
  Page 391 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page391"></a>{391}</span>at
  <i>Tangier</i>, the Moon being very near the same place, where she was
  now.</p>

<h3><i>Extract
of a Letter, lately written by Mr. </i>Nathaniel Fairfax<i> to the
</i>Publisher<i>, containing Observations about some </i>Insects<i>, and
their Inoxiousness, &amp;c.</i></h3>

  <p>The Ingenious Author of this Letter, as he expresses an extraordinary
  desire to see the <i>Store-house</i> of <i>Natural Philosophy</i>, more
  richly fraughted (a Work begun by the single care and conduct of the
  Excellent Lord <i>Verulam</i>, and prosecuted by the Joynt-undertakings
  of the <i>R. Society</i>) so he very frankly offers his Service in
  contributing some of his Observations, and begins in this very Letter to
  perform his Offer. For, Having taken notice of what was publisht in
  <i>Numb. 9. p. <a href="#page161">161</a></i>. out of the <i>Italian</i>
  Philosopher <i>Redi</i>, vid. That Creatures, reputed Venomous, are
  indeed no Poysons, when swallow'd, though they may prove so, when put
  into Wounds: He, for confirmation thereof, alledges Examples of several
  Persons well known to him (himself also having been an Eye-witness to
  some such Experiments) who have frequently swallow'd <i>Spiders</i>, even
  of the rankest kind, without any more harm than happens to Hens,
  Robin-red-breasts, and other Birds, who make Spiders their daily Commons.
  And having made mention of some men, that eat even <i>Toads</i>, he adds,
  that though a Toad be not a Poyson to us in the whole; yet it may
  invenome outwardly, according to some parts so and so stirr'd; an
  instance whereof he alledges in a Boy, who stumbling on a Toad, and
  hurling stones at it, some Juyce from the bruised Toad chanced to light
  upon his Lips, whereupon they swell'd, each to the thickness of about two
  Thumbs: And he neglecting to use, what might be proper to restore them,
  they have continued in that mishapen size ever since; the ugliness
  whereof, when the Relator saw, gave him occasion to inquire after the
  cause of it, which thereupon he understood to be, as has been
  recited.</p>

  <p>On this occasion, the same Gentleman relates, that once seeing a
  Spider bruised into a small Glass of Water, and that it tinged <!-- Page
  392 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page392"></a>{392}</span>it
  somewhat of a Sky-colour, he was, upon owning his surprise thereat,
  informed, that a dozen of them being put in, they would dye it to almost
  a full <i>Azure</i>. Which is touch't here, that, the Experiment being so
  easie to make, it may be tried, when the season furnishes those Insects;
  meantime, it seems not more incredible, that this Creature should yield a
  Sky-colour, when put in water, than that <i>Cochineel</i>, which also is
  but an Insect, should afford a fine <i>red</i>, when steep'd in the same
  Liquor.</p>

<h3><i>An Account
Of Some Books.</i></h3>

  <p><i>I.</i> Le Tome troisieme et dernier des Lettres de <i>M.
  DES-CARTES</i>.</p>

  <p>As the two first <i>Tomes</i> of M. <i>Des-Cartes</i> his Letters,
  contain Questions, for the most part of a <i>Moral</i> and
  <i>Physiological</i> Nature, proposed to, and answer'd by him; so
  <i>this</i> consists of the Contests, he had upon several Subjects with
  divers Men eminent in his time.</p>

  <p>To pass by that sharp Contest, he was engaged in by some Professors of
  Divinity at <i>Utrecht</i>, who endeavoured to discredit his Philosophy,
  as leading to Libertinisme and Atheisme, notwithstanding he made it so
  much his business, <span class="correction" title="Original reads `as to assert', corrected by errata, page 407."
  >to assert</span> the Existence of a Deity, and the Immortality <span
  class="correction" title="Original reads `of a Soul', corrected by errata, page 407."
  >of the Soul:</span> We shall take notice of what is more to our purpose,
  <i>vid.</i> the Differences, he had touching his <i>Dioptricks</i> and
  <i>Geometry</i>.</p>

  <p>As for his <i>Dioptricks</i>, though a great part of the Learned World
  have much esteem'd that Treatise, as leaving little to be said after him
  upon that Subject; yet there have not been wanting Mathematicians, who
  have declared their disagreement from his Principles in that Doctrine.
  The first of them was the Jesuit <i>Bourdin</i>, Mathematick Professor in
  the Colledg of <i>Clermont</i> at <i>Paris</i>; but this difference was
  soon at an end. A second was Mr. <i>Hobbs</i>, upon whose account he
  wrote several Letters to <i>Mersennus</i>, containing many remarks
  conducing to the Knowledge of the Nature of <i>Reflection</i> and
  <i>Refraction</i>. But the Person, that did most learnedly and resolutely
  attack the said <i>Dioptricks</i>, was Monsieur <i>Fermat</i>, <!-- Page
  393 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page393"></a>{393}</span>writing
  first about it to <i>Mersennus</i>, who soon communicated his Objections
  to M. <i>Des-Cartes</i>, who failed not to return his Answer to them. But
  <i>Fermat</i> replied, and <i>Des-Cartes</i> likewise; and after many
  reciprocations, in which each party pretended to have the advantage, the
  matter rested; until M. <i>Fermat</i> taking occasion to write afresh of
  it to M. <i>De la Chambre</i>, several years after <i>Des-Cartes</i>'s
  death, upon occasion of a Book, written M. <i>De la Chambre</i>, <i>Of
  Light</i>; discoursed with this new <i>Author</i> after the same rate, as
  he had done before with <i>Des-Cartes</i> himself, and seemed to invite
  some-body of his friends, to re-assume the former contest. Whereupon M.
  <i>Clerselier</i> and M. <i>Rohault</i> took up the Gantlet, to assert
  the Doctrine of the deceased Philosopher, exchanging several Letters with
  M. <i>Fermat</i>, all inserted in this <i>Tome</i>, and serving fully to
  instruct the Reader of this Difference, and withal to elucidate many
  difficult points of the Subject of <i>Refractions</i>; especially of this
  particular, <i>Whether the Motion of Light is more easily, and with more
  expedition, perform'd through </i>dense<i> Mediums, than
  </i>rare<i>.</i></p>

  <p>Besides this, though one would think, Disputes had no place in
  <i>Geometry</i>, since all proofs there, are as many Demonstrations; yet
  M. <i>Des-Cartes</i> hath had several scufles touching that Science. As
  M. <i>Fermat</i> had assaulted his <i>Dioptricks</i>, so He reciprocally
  examined his Treatise <i>De Maximis &amp; Minimis</i>, pretending to have
  met with <i>Paralogismes</i> in it. But the Cause of M. <i>Fermat</i> was
  learnedly pleaded for, by some of his Friends, who took their turn to
  examine the Treatise of <i>Des-Carte</i>'s Geometry; whereupon many
  <i>Letters</i> were exchanged, to be found this Book, and deserving to be
  considered; which doubtless the Curious would easily be induced to do, if
  Copies of this Book were to be obtain'd here in <i>England</i>, besides
  that one, which the <i>Publisher</i> received from his <i>Parisian</i>
  Correspondent, and which affords him the opportunity of giving this,
  though but Cursory, Account of it.</p>

  <p>As to <i>Physicks</i>, there occur chiefly two Questions, learnedly
  treated of in this <i>Volume</i>, though not without some heat between M.
  <i>Des-Cartes</i> and M. <i>Roberval</i>. The <i>one</i> is, touching the
  Vibrations of Bodies suspended in the Air, and their Center of Agitation:
  about which, there is also a Letter inserted of <!-- Page 394 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page394"></a>{394}</span>M. <i>Des-Cartes</i> to
  that late Noble and Learned English Knight, Sir <i>Charles Cavendish</i>.
  The <i>other</i> is, whether Motion can be made without supposing a
  <i>Vacuum</i>: where 'tis represented, That, if one comprehend well the
  Nature, ascribed to the <i>Materia subtilis</i>, and how Motions, called
  <i>Circular</i>, are made, which need not be just <i>Ovals</i> or
  <i>true</i> Circles, but are only called Circular, in regard that their
  Motion ends, where it had begun, whatever irregularity there be in the
  Middle; and also, that all the Inequalities, that may be in the Magnitude
  or Figure of the parts, may be compensated by other inequalities, met
  with in their Swiftness, and by the facility, with which the parts of the
  <i>Subtle Matter</i>, or of the first <i>Cartesian</i> Element, which are
  found every where, happen to be divided, or to accommodate their Figure
  to the Space, they are to fill up: If these things be well understood and
  considered, that then no difficulty can remain touching the Motion of the
  parts of Matter <i>in pleno</i>.</p>

  <p>Besides all these particulars, treated of in this <i>Tome</i>, there
  occur many pretty Questions concerning <i>Numbers</i>, the
  <i>Cycloid</i>, the manner of <i>Working Glasses for Telescopes</i>, the
  way of <i>Weighing Air</i>, and many other Curiosities, Mathematical and
  Physical.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p><i>II. </i>ASTRONOMIA REFORMATA<i>, Auctore </i>JOHANNE BAPT.
  RICCIOLI<i>, Soc. Jesu.</i></p>

  <p>For the Notice of this Book, and the Account of the Chief Heads
  contained therein, we are obliged to the <i>Journal des Scavans</i>;
  which informs us,</p>

  <p><i>First</i>, That the Design of this Work is, that, because several
  <i>Astronomers</i>, having had their several <i>Hypotheses</i>, there is
  found so great a diversity of opinions, that it is difficult thence to
  conclude any thing certain; this Author judged it also necessary, to
  compare together all the best Observations, and upon examination of what
  they have most certain in them, to reform upon that measure the
  Principles of Astronomy.</p>

  <p><i>Secondly</i>, That this <i>Volume</i> is divided into two Parts,
  whereof the <i>First</i> is composed of <i>Ten</i> Books; in which the
  Author <!-- Page 395 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page395"></a>{395}</span>considers the principal Observations,
  hitherto made of the Motion of the Planets and the Fixed Stars, of their
  Magnitude, Figure, and other Accidents; drawing thence several
  Conclusions, in which he establishes his <i>Hypothesis</i>. The
  <i>second</i> contains his <i>Astronomical Tables</i>, made according to
  the <i>Hypotheses</i> of the First Part, together with Instructions
  teaching the manner of using them.</p>

  <p><i>Thirdly</i>, That Astronomers will find in this Book many very
  remarkable things, concerning the <i>Apparent Diameter of the Sun</i> and
  the other Stars, the Motion of the <i>Libration of the Moon</i>, the
  <i>Eclipses</i>, <i>Parallaxes</i>, and <i>Refractions</i>: And that this
  Author shews, that there is a great difference between <i>Optical</i> and
  <i>Astronomical</i> Refraction, which <i>Tycho</i> and many others have
  confounded; undertaking to prove, that, whereas these <i>Astronomers</i>
  have believed, that the remoter any Star is, the less is its Refraction,
  on the contrary the Refraction is the greater, the more a Star is
  distant. And among many other things, he ingeniously explicates the two
  contrary Motions of the Sun, from East to West, and <i>vice versa</i>, by
  one onely Motion upon a <i>Spiral</i>, turning about a <i>Cone</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Fourthly</i>, That he represents, How uneasie it is to establish
  sure Principles of this Science, by reason of the difficulties of making
  exact Observations. So, for example, in the Observation of the
  <i>Equinox</i>, every one is mistaken by so many <i>Hours</i>, as he is
  of <i>Minutes</i>, in the Elevation of the <i>Pole</i>, or the Diameter
  of the Sun, or the Refraction, or in any other circumstance. In the
  Observation of the <i>Solstice</i>, the error of one only <i>Second</i>
  causeth a mistake of an <i>Hour</i> and an <i>half</i>: mean time 'tis
  almost impossible to avoid the error of a <i>Second</i>; and even the
  sharpest sight will not be able to perceive it, except it be assisted
  with an Instrument of a prodigious bigness. For to mark <i>Seconds</i>,
  though Lines were drawn as subtil as the single threds of a Silk-worms
  Clew, (which are the smallest spaces to be discerned by the sharpest Eye)
  by the Calculation made by this Author there would need an Instrument of
  48. feet <i>Radius</i>, since Experience shews, that there needs no more
  at most, than 3600. threds of Silk to cover the space of an <i>inch</i>.
  But, suppose one could have a <i>Quadrant</i> of this bigness, who can
  assure himself, that dividing it into <!-- Page 396 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page396"></a>{396}</span>324000. parts (for so
  many <i>Seconds</i> there are in 90. <i>Degrees</i>) either in placing
  it, or in observing, he shall not mistake the thickness of a single thred
  of Silk? He adds, that Great Instruments have their defects, as the small
  ones: For in those, that are <i>Movable</i>, if the thred, on which the
  Lead hangs, is any thing big, it cannot exactly mark <i>Seconds</i>; if
  it be very fine, it breaks, because of its great length, and the weight
  of the Lead: And in the <i>Fixed</i> ones, the greater the
  <i>Diameter</i> is, the less the Shadow or the Light is terminated; so
  that it is painful enough, exactly to discern the extremities thereof.
  Yet 'tis certain, that the greater the Instruments are, the surer
  <i>Astronomers</i> may be: Whence it is, the some <i>Astronomers</i> have
  made use of <i>Obelisks</i> of a vast bigness, to take the
  <i>Altitudes</i>; and Signior <i>Cassini</i>, after the example of
  <i>Egnatio Dante</i>, caused a hole to be made on the highest part of a
  Wall of 95. feet in a Church at <i>Bononia</i>, through which the beams
  of the Sun falling on the Floor, mark as exactly as is possible, the
  height of that Luminary.</p>

  <p><i>Fifthly</i>, That the Author reasons for the <i>Immobility of the
  Earth</i> after this manner. He supposes for certain, that the swiftness
  of the Motion of heavy bodies doth still <i>increase</i> in their
  descent; to confirm which principle, he affirms to have experimented,
  That, if you let fall a Ball into one of the Scales of a Ballance,
  according to the proportion of the height, it falls from, it raiseth
  different weights in the other Scale. For example, A Wooden Ball, of 1½
  ounce, falling from a height of 35 inches, raiseth a weight of 5. ounces;
  from the height of 140 inches, a weight of 20 ounces; from that of 315
  inches, one of 45 ounces; and from another of 560 inches, one of 80
  ounces, &amp;c. From this principle he concludes the Earth to be at Rest;
  for <i>saith he</i>, if it should have a Diurnal Motion upon its Center,
  Heavy Bodies being carried along with it by its motion, would in
  descending describe a <i>Curve Line</i>, and, as he shews by a
  <i>Calculus</i>, made by him, run equal spaces in equal times; whence it
  follows, that the Celerity of their Motion would not increase in
  descending, and that consequently their stroke would not be stronger,
  after they had fallen thorow a longer space. <!-- Page 397 --><span

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p><i>III. </i>ANATOME MEDULLAE SPINALIS, ET NERVORUM<i> inde
  provenientium, </i>GERARDI BLASII<i>, M. D.</i></p>

  <p>The Author shews in this little <i>Tract</i> a way of taking the
  entire <i>Medulla Spinalis</i>, or Marrow of the Back, out of its
  <i>Theca</i> or Bony Receptacle <i>without Laceration</i>; which else
  happens frequently, both of the Nerves proceeding from it, and of the
  Coats investing it; not to name other parts of the same. This he affirms
  to have been put into practice by himself, by a fine Saw and Wedge; which
  are to be dexterously used: and he produceth accordingly in excellent
  Cuts, the Representations of the Structure of the said <i>Medulla</i>
  thus taken out, and the <i>Nerves</i>, thence proceeding; and that of
  several Animals, Dogs, Swine, Sheep.</p>

  <p>He intermixes several Observations, touching the <i>Singleness</i> of
  this <i>Medulla</i>, against <i>Lindanus</i> and others; its
  <i>Original</i>; vid. Whether it be the Root of the Brain, or the Brain
  the Root of it: its difference of <i>Softness</i> and <i>Hardness</i> in
  several Animals; where he notes, that in <i>Swine</i> it is much softer
  than in Dogs, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>He exhibits also the Arteries, Nerves, and Veins, dispersed through
  this <i>Medulla</i>, and inquires, Whether the <i>Nerves</i> proceed from
  the <i>Medulla</i> it self, or its <i>Meninx</i>; and discourses also of
  the <i>Principle</i> and <i>Distribution</i> of the Nerves; referring for
  ampler information in this and the other particulars, to that Excellent
  Book of the Learned Dr. <i>Willis</i>, <i>De Anatome Cerebri</i>. <!--

  <p>That though in this last Head there is repeated the <i>Transfusion</i>
  of Blood, because the Operation is an Art requiring diligence, and a
  practised hand to perform it for all advantagious Discoveries, and so to
  be distinguish'd from the <i>Anatomical</i> Account; yet that there is
  not affected noise and number, may well appear by reviewing and comparing
  the particulars of <i>Artificial Instruments</i> in the <!-- Page 407
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page407"></a>{407}</span><i>Table</i>,
  where sometimes one Engin or Instrument may minister Aid to discover a
  large branch of Philosophy, as the <i>Baroscope</i>, an <i>Optick
  Glass</i>, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>And very particularly M. <i>Rook</i>'s directions for Seamen, which
  specifies Instruments, may hereunto belong.</p>

  <p>And sometimes in one of the Discourses herein mention'd, and
  abbreviated, there are almost as many Artificial Inventions, as
  Experiments; as in Mr. <i>Boyle</i>'s Hydrostatical Experiments: Besides
  all the Chymical Operations, recited in the <i>Treatise</i> of the
  <i>Origine of Forms</i>, &amp;c.</p>
